# Post-Production Planning

## 📽️ Overview

This repository contains the post-production planning workflow and documentation for creating AI-enabled video courses. The project focuses on developing an efficient, AI-driven workflow for producing advanced technical content while managing the complexity of multiple assets (screen captures, voiceovers, images, and animations).

## 🎯 Project Purpose

The main goal is to transition from traditional manual editing workflows to an **AI-enabled post-production process** that:

- Creates structured, step-by-step editing plans using AI (Gemini)
- Provides clear asset mapping with numbered coding systems
- Reduces cognitive load for editors by providing detailed guidance
- Enables production of high-density technical content for advanced learners
- Streamlines the editing process for complex multi-module courses

## 🚗 The "Horse vs. Car" Metaphor

This project represents a shift from traditional editing methods ("horses") to AI-enabled workflows ("cars"). The AI-driven approach uses tools like Gemini to create detailed post-production plans that guide editors through complex technical content assembly.

## 🔑 Key Challenges Addressed

1. **Audio-Video Synchronization**: Aligning voiceovers with screen captures and slides
2. **Asset Management**: Organizing multiple images, videos, and Post-it notes
3. **Cognitive Load**: Balancing fast-paced technical demonstrations with learner comprehension
4. **Content Clarity**: Providing clear guidance for editors unfamiliar with technical subject matter
5. **Workflow Efficiency**: Reducing production time while maintaining quality

## 💡 Solution Approach

### AI-Enabled Planning
- Use Gemini to generate step-by-step post-production roadmaps
- Create numbered asset coding (1, 2, 3) for precise sequencing
- Provide clear instructions for when to show images vs. videos

### Template Creation
- Edit one benchmark video as a quality reference
- Record the editing process as training material
- Document the workflow for replication across modules

### Structured Workflow
- Scene numbers for easy navigation
- Voiceover Post-it notes with timing guidance
- Storyboard references for visual context
- Artifact mapping for precise asset placement

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Review the meeting summaries to understand the workflow requirements
2. Check the references for external tools and templates
3. Follow the AI-enabled planning approach outlined in the action items
4. Wait for the benchmark video and training materials
5. Apply the learned workflow to subsequent modules

## 🤝 Team Collaboration

The project involves collaboration between:
- **Content Creator/SME**: Rifat
- **Post-Production Team**: Starweaver (Hari, Swati, Sanjia, Hanuk)
- **AI Tools**: Gemini for planning and guidance

## 📌 Key Principles

1. **AI-First Approach**: Leverage AI for planning and workflow optimization
2. **Structured Asset Management**: Use numbered coding and clear organization
3. **Template-Based Production**: Create reusable patterns for efficiency
4. **Quality Standards**: Maintain high production values while optimizing speed
5. **Clear Communication**: Provide detailed guidance for non-expert editors
