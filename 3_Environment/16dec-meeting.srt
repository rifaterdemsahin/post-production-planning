01:03:50,616 --> 01:03:58,683
 (Exhales) (Bell Dings)

2
01:05:22,033 --> 01:05:23,199
 our

3
01:05:24,066 --> 01:05:25,866
.</

4
01:05:33,550 --> 01:05:36,199
 I gave a short of everyone.

5
01:05:36,199 --> 01:05:36,949
 You already have met

6
01:05:36,949 --> 01:05:38,250
 Swati, Sanjia and Hanuk.

7
01:05:38,949 --> 01:05:42,866
 Hari is from our production team and

8
01:05:42,866 --> 01:05:44,383
 Swati is more from the

9
01:05:44,383 --> 01:05:45,283
 post-production team.

10
01:05:45,783 --> 01:05:50,166
 So Hari right now edited your demo screen

11
01:05:50,166 --> 01:05:51,050
 share that you shared.

12
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,133
 And then we shared it with Sanjia and

13
01:05:54,133 --> 01:05:55,683
 Hanuk for the final review.

14
01:05:56,483 --> 01:05:58,966
 So then Hanuk has a few

15
01:05:58,966 --> 01:06:01,183
 observations on the screen share.

16
01:06:02,983 --> 01:06:05,283
 The way you are creating is still okay

17
01:06:05,283 --> 01:06:07,783
 but the concept on which it's been...

18
01:06:07,933 --> 01:06:11,033
 created is not being understandable as

19
01:06:11,033 --> 01:06:12,583
 per my understanding of Hanuk.

20
01:06:13,650 --> 01:06:15,933
 So I'll hand it over to Hanuk.

21
01:06:15,933 --> 01:06:17,066
 Hanuk can explain better

22
01:06:17,066 --> 01:06:18,366
 as to what is the issue.

23
01:06:18,616 --> 01:06:20,750
 And before that, Hari, can you play that

24
01:06:20,750 --> 01:06:23,366
 video for us to understand that the audio

25
01:06:23,366 --> 01:06:24,699
 and video are not syncing.

26
01:06:25,500 --> 01:06:28,566
 So in one of the slides, as per Hari,

27
01:06:29,633 --> 01:06:32,550
 slide 6 audio is coming in slide 7 audio,

28
01:06:32,550 --> 01:06:33,266
 something like that.

29
01:06:34,483 --> 01:06:36,083
 All right, very good.

30
01:06:36,383 --> 01:06:40,066
 Let's try it and see it and try to

31
01:06:40,066 --> 01:06:43,650
 understand it because what I did was, if

32
01:06:43,650 --> 01:06:47,283
 I share my screen, before we start, I

33
01:06:47,283 --> 01:06:50,383
 created a video around this as well.

34
01:06:51,333 --> 01:06:54,183
 So you guys should be able to see this.

35
01:06:54,183 --> 01:06:55,433
 Can you guys see my screen?

36
01:06:57,199 --> 01:06:57,616
 Yes.

37
01:06:57,933 --> 01:07:02,449
 So what I tried to do was I tried to edit

38
01:07:02,449 --> 01:07:06,166
 it myself so I will be able to see it

39
01:07:06,166 --> 01:07:10,466
 myself as well, put myself into the same

40
01:07:10,466 --> 01:07:13,449
 shoes with the post-production team.

41
01:07:13,866 --> 01:07:16,316
 So what I did was, in

42
01:07:16,316 --> 01:07:18,766
 a nutshell, on here,

43
01:07:19,833 --> 01:07:22,116
 first of all, what I did was I gave you

44
01:07:22,116 --> 01:07:24,916
 guys Google Drive folders for

45
01:07:24,916 --> 01:07:27,183
 everything, for the voiceover.

46
01:07:27,433 --> 01:07:29,116
 So the voiceover can

47
01:07:29,116 --> 01:07:31,050
 be changed at any place.

48
01:07:31,050 --> 01:07:31,966
 It is at the bottom.

49
01:07:32,183 --> 01:07:33,699
 There is a voiceover.

50
01:07:34,033 --> 01:07:36,050
 So the voiceover can be

51
01:07:36,050 --> 01:07:37,783
 easily tracked everywhere.

52
01:07:38,250 --> 01:07:40,733
 So how can it be tracked the voiceover?

53
01:07:40,733 --> 01:07:43,616
 If you guys see the file names, there is

54
01:07:43,616 --> 01:07:44,783
 a voiceover file name.

55
01:07:44,833 --> 01:07:47,066
 And that voiceover file

56
01:07:47,066 --> 01:07:48,449
 name is on Storyboard.

57
01:07:48,933 --> 01:07:50,166
 But do not use the

58
01:07:50,166 --> 01:07:53,133
 Storyboard to line up the audio.

59
01:07:53,416 --> 01:07:56,633
 The audio is in the voiceover audio file.

60
01:07:57,033 --> 01:07:59,133
 But how are you going to put the

61
01:07:59,133 --> 01:08:02,150
 voiceover audio to the correct slide?

62
01:08:02,949 --> 01:08:05,500
 That key lands in the slide.

63
01:08:05,866 --> 01:08:08,116
 So all of this combo has at

64
01:08:08,116 --> 01:08:09,783
 the bottom a voiceover posted.

65
01:08:10,683 --> 01:08:12,783
 So once you look at the voiceover post-

66
01:08:13,433 --> 01:08:15,433
 You know that how it's going to land

67
01:08:15,433 --> 01:08:18,033
 because I put these voiceovers.

68
01:08:18,399 --> 01:08:19,583
 I did not edit them.

69
01:08:19,816 --> 01:08:23,816
 I put a Rough voiceover so it will be one

70
01:08:23,816 --> 01:08:27,050
 second behind one second after so they

71
01:08:27,050 --> 01:08:30,183
 had to be mapped with these voiceovers at

72
01:08:30,183 --> 01:08:33,166
 the bottom post-its and I put all these

73
01:08:33,449 --> 01:08:37,383
 Screen captures with the number coding on

74
01:08:37,383 --> 01:08:39,933
 here So in the combat you should be able

75
01:08:39,933 --> 01:08:42,649
 to find it with the number codes and the

76
01:08:42,649 --> 01:08:45,750
 number codes are already placed In the

77
01:08:45,750 --> 01:08:48,533
 output slides so they are very

78
01:08:48,533 --> 01:08:50,500
 straightforward and I put all the

79
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:53,783
 references into one file and created this

80
01:08:53,783 --> 01:08:56,899
 into a Video format that could be easily

81
01:08:56,899 --> 01:09:00,449
 found if this says scene 5 that it is the

82
01:09:00,449 --> 01:09:03,550
 fifth scene In the system, and how do you

83
01:09:03,550 --> 01:09:04,583
 place it on timeline?

84
01:09:05,116 --> 01:09:08,166
 I put the storyboard as you guys will be

85
01:09:08,166 --> 01:09:12,166
 able to listen it and do it easily And

86
01:09:12,166 --> 01:09:14,666
 all of these scenes have seen numbers

87
01:09:15,083 --> 01:09:17,883
 Inside them so you know which scene you

88
01:09:17,883 --> 01:09:20,883
 are at without even looking at combo But

89
01:09:20,883 --> 01:09:23,383
 combo is there to be able to support you

90
01:09:23,383 --> 01:09:26,683
 I put this into the wind result You will

91
01:09:26,683 --> 01:09:28,149
 be able to see the scene

92
01:09:28,149 --> 01:09:31,333
 number as for s5 s6 as we

93
01:09:32,533 --> 01:09:33,750
 Start off the scene.

94
01:09:33,750 --> 01:09:36,816
 This is the rough audio as you guys see

95
01:09:36,816 --> 01:09:39,500
 scene is here But there's one second gap

96
01:09:39,500 --> 01:09:41,750
 you need to move this to the left hand

97
01:09:41,750 --> 01:09:44,316
 side There is one second gap you need to

98
01:09:44,316 --> 01:09:45,750
 move this to the left hand side.

99
01:09:45,750 --> 01:09:48,566
 I did not cut this I expected the

100
01:09:48,566 --> 01:09:51,266
 post-production team to cut it and place

101
01:09:51,266 --> 01:09:52,316
 it, but don't forget.

102
01:09:52,316 --> 01:09:55,833
 There's also the Posted notes which has

103
01:09:55,833 --> 01:09:59,866
 the voiceovers on top of tanda so that in

104
01:09:59,866 --> 01:10:02,133
 the editing It should be able to go there

105
01:10:02,133 --> 01:10:04,233
 And you are not going to use the

106
01:10:04,233 --> 01:10:06,883
 voiceover on the storyboard You are going

107
01:10:06,883 --> 01:10:09,866
 to use the voiceover in the module one to

108
01:10:09,866 --> 01:10:12,266
 be able to place it properly So there's a

109
01:10:12,266 --> 01:10:14,500
 clean voiceover as well

110
01:10:14,500 --> 01:10:16,983
 that I recorded in audiosity

111
01:10:17,833 --> 01:10:18,883
 you place the footage

112
01:10:18,883 --> 01:10:20,316
 for the screen capture.

113
01:10:20,866 --> 01:10:23,250
 You know the footage ID and

114
01:10:23,250 --> 01:10:26,133
 you know the scene over there.

115
01:10:26,466 --> 01:10:30,116
 You are going to meet the storyboard,

116
01:10:30,816 --> 01:10:33,816
 place it in the correct place and set the

117
01:10:33,816 --> 01:10:35,316
 screen capture over there.

118
01:10:35,683 --> 01:10:38,233
 Then you are going to collect the visuals

119
01:10:38,449 --> 01:10:41,616
 and do a sanity check because I put the

120
01:10:41,616 --> 01:10:45,166
 visuals onto the combo by going into

121
01:10:45,166 --> 01:10:48,116
 combo and being able to download it by

122
01:10:48,116 --> 01:10:51,500
 right clicking on it and do a download

123
01:10:51,500 --> 01:10:55,433
 selection on here in a very easy manner.

124
01:10:55,649 --> 01:10:56,633
 So that's going to

125
01:10:56,633 --> 01:10:59,633
 help you be able to do it

126
01:11:00,649 --> 01:11:02,050
 directly over here.

127
01:11:02,316 --> 01:11:04,383
 So there's a voiceover

128
01:11:04,383 --> 01:11:06,683
 screen capture over there.

129
01:11:06,683 --> 01:11:08,949
 So that will let you be

130
01:11:08,949 --> 01:11:11,316
 able to download it as well.

131
01:11:11,850 --> 01:11:14,000
 So that is in a nutshell.

132
01:11:14,583 --> 01:11:17,266
 Which part is the problematic part for

133
01:11:17,266 --> 01:11:19,449
 you, Hanukkah, in here

134
01:11:19,449 --> 01:11:21,250
 to be able to not do it?

135
01:11:25,316 --> 01:11:27,050
 I'll tell you, see the thing is,

136
01:11:29,133 --> 01:11:31,633
 now like once this gets edited, once the

137
01:11:31,633 --> 01:11:34,483
 audio is in sync, maybe I might have a

138
01:11:34,483 --> 01:11:36,783
 different opinion, but see the thing is

139
01:11:36,783 --> 01:11:39,533
 still the problems which I foresee is

140
01:11:41,216 --> 01:11:41,816
 whatever you were

141
01:11:41,816 --> 01:11:43,116
 mentioning in the narration, right?

142
01:11:43,933 --> 01:11:45,883
 And whatever is there in the screen, like

143
01:11:45,883 --> 01:11:47,683
 I understand that those things are

144
01:11:47,683 --> 01:11:49,350
 relatable because we

145
01:11:49,350 --> 01:11:51,616
 have additional information,

146
01:11:52,899 --> 01:11:55,216
 not excess information on the screen, but

147
01:11:55,216 --> 01:11:57,966
 the narration is talking about some

148
01:11:57,966 --> 01:12:00,333
 generic things and it's much more

149
01:12:00,333 --> 01:12:02,066
 abstract, not kind of specific.

150
01:12:02,500 --> 01:12:03,383
 This is what I felt.

151
01:12:03,766 --> 01:12:06,750
 And as I've already said that the

152
01:12:06,750 --> 01:12:08,233
 voiceover and demo is,

153
01:12:09,366 --> 01:12:10,649
 just a second, let me

154
01:12:10,649 --> 01:12:13,266
 complete, maybe you can add after that.

155
01:12:13,850 --> 01:12:15,266
 Otherwise I'll lose my train of thought

156
01:12:15,683 --> 01:12:17,316
 if that's okay with you.

157
01:12:17,816 --> 01:12:19,533
 So as I was saying, the

158
01:12:19,533 --> 01:12:22,000
 voiceover and the demo was not.

159
01:12:22,816 --> 01:12:24,033
 modern sync, first of all.

160
01:12:24,183 --> 01:12:26,716
 So you said that maybe we might have to

161
01:12:26,716 --> 01:12:28,933
 adjust it a little bit, then that

162
01:12:28,933 --> 01:12:29,949
 particular thing would be solved.

163
01:12:30,283 --> 01:12:32,583
 But still, as I've said, the second

164
01:12:32,583 --> 01:12:36,500
 problem was that there were a lot of

165
01:12:36,500 --> 01:12:39,466
 things on the screen, but I can

166
01:12:39,466 --> 01:12:41,449
 understand that from a technical point of

167
01:12:41,449 --> 01:12:44,116
 view, maybe as a subject matter expert,

168
01:12:44,466 --> 01:12:46,350
 you might find that this is something

169
01:12:46,350 --> 01:12:48,616
 which is kind of, these

170
01:12:48,616 --> 01:12:50,000
 would be relatable things.

171
01:12:50,633 --> 01:12:55,883
 But from a learner's perspective, or when

172
01:12:55,883 --> 01:12:59,533
 I look at it things, I cannot relate with

173
01:12:59,533 --> 01:13:00,250
 what you are saying.

174
01:13:00,500 --> 01:13:02,399
 There are a few things that are there on

175
01:13:02,399 --> 01:13:04,033
 the screen, which I can see and what you

176
01:13:04,033 --> 01:13:05,433
 are saying, but those

177
01:13:05,433 --> 01:13:07,649
 are not in a direct way.

178
01:13:08,149 --> 01:13:09,133
 All right, and the

179
01:13:09,133 --> 01:13:10,816
 demos, which I see, right?

180
01:13:10,866 --> 01:13:14,033
 So the demos also like what I expect is

181
01:13:14,083 --> 01:13:15,716
 that the demo should be

182
01:13:15,716 --> 01:13:17,583
 for a concrete example.

183
01:13:18,033 --> 01:13:20,350
 All right, so and then for a given

184
01:13:20,350 --> 01:13:23,766
 concrete example, you would have to kind

185
01:13:23,766 --> 01:13:25,933
 of divide the demo into different steps,

186
01:13:25,933 --> 01:13:27,316
 like step one, step two, step three.

187
01:13:27,816 --> 01:13:31,399
 All right, and then maybe in step one,

188
01:13:31,399 --> 01:13:33,233
 you would say that, okay, install this.

189
01:13:33,666 --> 01:13:35,866
 All right, maybe there was a step wherein

190
01:13:35,866 --> 01:13:38,366
 you go on to GitHub and then over there,

191
01:13:38,649 --> 01:13:40,083
 you would have, instead of doing it

192
01:13:40,083 --> 01:13:42,149
 locally, you are adding some code spaces,

193
01:13:42,383 --> 01:13:43,616
 you are doing it on code spaces.

194
01:13:43,616 --> 01:13:45,366
 I do not know, I'm not a technical person

195
01:13:45,366 --> 01:13:47,083
 over here to comment on that.

196
01:13:47,116 --> 01:13:48,583
 So maybe, so the thing is

197
01:13:48,583 --> 01:13:50,250
 you can just take an example,

198
01:13:51,466 --> 01:13:53,666
 you can do the demo for an example

199
01:13:53,666 --> 01:13:55,666
 scenario, hypothetical scenario or a

200
01:13:55,666 --> 01:13:57,566
 hypothetical example, the different steps

201
01:13:57,566 --> 01:13:59,683
 involved, and alternatively, you can

202
01:13:59,683 --> 01:14:01,733
 mention the different alternative steps,

203
01:14:01,733 --> 01:14:04,216
 like you can do this locally as well, but

204
01:14:04,216 --> 01:14:07,316
 the focus should be on the example

205
01:14:07,316 --> 01:14:08,266
 scenario that you have

206
01:14:08,266 --> 01:14:09,683
 taken to meet the objective.

207
01:14:10,166 --> 01:14:11,316
 And accordingly, the steps

208
01:14:11,316 --> 01:14:12,716
 would have to be broken down.

209
01:14:12,716 --> 01:14:15,166
 I'm not expecting you to show the entire

210
01:14:15,166 --> 01:14:16,983
 execution of those steps.

211
01:14:17,483 --> 01:14:20,716
 You just mentioned the important pointers

212
01:14:20,983 --> 01:14:24,466
 or the codes or the steps that the

213
01:14:24,466 --> 01:14:25,633
 learner would have to perform

214
01:14:25,633 --> 01:14:27,783
 for a given major step, right?

215
01:14:27,833 --> 01:14:30,399
 like the first step would be maybe for

216
01:14:30,399 --> 01:14:31,433
 installing something.

217
01:14:31,883 --> 01:14:34,533
 All right, and then that is where you

218
01:14:34,533 --> 01:14:37,283
 show the code for installing, okay, and

219
01:14:37,283 --> 01:14:38,649
 this is, I'm just

220
01:14:38,649 --> 01:14:40,716
 randomly speaking over here.

221
01:14:41,033 --> 01:14:43,066
 I'm not sure if this applies to your demo

222
01:14:43,066 --> 01:14:45,633
 or not, but there was a step for

223
01:14:45,633 --> 01:14:46,649
 installing installation.

224
01:14:46,866 --> 01:14:47,616
 I've seen that.

225
01:14:48,033 --> 01:14:49,933
 So you need not to show the entire

226
01:14:49,933 --> 01:14:50,833
 process of installation.

227
01:14:50,833 --> 01:14:53,066
 You just say that use this code for

228
01:14:53,066 --> 01:14:55,949
 installing and then you just skip to that

229
01:14:55,949 --> 01:14:57,833
 part where the installation is complete

230
01:14:58,166 --> 01:14:59,899
 and then you move on to the next step.

231
01:14:59,899 --> 01:15:01,616
 Maybe next step would be kind of maybe

232
01:15:01,616 --> 01:15:05,316
 integrating onto the GitHub or doing it

233
01:15:05,316 --> 01:15:06,683
 on code spaces or locally.

234
01:15:06,683 --> 01:15:07,066
 I'm not sure.

235
01:15:07,500 --> 01:15:10,783
 All right, so I want, so at present, it

236
01:15:10,783 --> 01:15:11,866
 is very difficult to

237
01:15:11,866 --> 01:15:13,883
 understand the flow of the demo.

238
01:15:13,883 --> 01:15:15,966
 You know, like what are the steps that

239
01:15:15,966 --> 01:15:17,783
 the learner would have to kind of perform

240
01:15:17,783 --> 01:15:18,583
 to attain the

241
01:15:18,583 --> 01:15:19,949
 objective of the video, right?

242
01:15:20,283 --> 01:15:21,816
 Maybe if we are trying to build something

243
01:15:21,816 --> 01:15:23,750
 over here, so that building should,

244
01:15:24,316 --> 01:15:26,683
 building that particular thing should

245
01:15:26,683 --> 01:15:29,250
 involve one, two, three steps, all right?

246
01:15:29,433 --> 01:15:32,033
 These steps which would be, which can be

247
01:15:32,033 --> 01:15:35,116
 applied for any such example, all right?

248
01:15:35,366 --> 01:15:36,466
 Any such example.

249
01:15:36,466 --> 01:15:37,233
 So you would have to

250
01:15:37,233 --> 01:15:38,816
 take a concrete example.

251
01:15:38,816 --> 01:15:40,366
 You would have, your focus should be that

252
01:15:40,666 --> 01:15:43,583
 and maybe alternatively, you can mention

253
01:15:43,583 --> 01:15:45,266
 few things that can be covered.

254
01:15:45,816 --> 01:15:49,050
 So what I felt was this was, there were

255
01:15:49,050 --> 01:15:51,949
 portions in the screen shares which felt

256
01:15:51,949 --> 01:15:53,949
 more like conceptual portions, all right?

257
01:15:54,133 --> 01:15:54,816
 Because there were

258
01:15:54,816 --> 01:15:56,483
 generic discussions going on.

259
01:15:56,816 --> 01:15:57,983
 You are talking about

260
01:15:57,983 --> 01:15:59,866
 generic things, all right?

261
01:15:59,983 --> 01:16:01,733
 So those things would have

262
01:16:01,733 --> 01:16:03,733
 to be covered in a conceptual,

263
01:16:04,883 --> 01:16:05,766
 because okay, these are the

264
01:16:05,766 --> 01:16:07,116
 techniques that are involved.

265
01:16:07,533 --> 01:16:08,050
 That's fine.

266
01:16:08,050 --> 01:16:09,433
 You need not to dig deep into it.

267
01:16:09,433 --> 01:16:10,933
 You can tell that, okay, these are the

268
01:16:10,933 --> 01:16:12,216
 alternatives that we have.

269
01:16:12,733 --> 01:16:13,566
 So that's fine.

270
01:16:14,266 --> 01:16:17,366
 And yeah, so this is how I want you to

271
01:16:17,366 --> 01:16:19,850
 approach the demo because it's very

272
01:16:19,850 --> 01:16:20,899
 difficult to follow at

273
01:16:20,899 --> 01:16:21,683
 this particular point.

274
01:16:21,899 --> 01:16:24,550
 You can go ahead and add your points.

275
01:16:25,033 --> 01:16:28,033
 You talked about only two points.

276
01:16:28,716 --> 01:16:31,250
 I'm recording this and I will go over it

277
01:16:31,250 --> 01:16:32,433
 to make sure that I understood.

278
01:16:33,183 --> 01:16:35,466
 First, you said you are

279
01:16:35,466 --> 01:16:37,566
 unable to put the voiceovers.

280
01:16:38,066 --> 01:16:39,283
 This is the first part.

281
01:16:40,483 --> 01:16:41,833
 The second part you said

282
01:16:41,833 --> 01:16:43,683
 you had a flow problem.

283
01:16:44,550 --> 01:16:45,333
 Is that correct?

284
01:16:45,816 --> 01:16:46,033
 Two points?

285
01:16:47,066 --> 01:16:47,683
 Only two.

286
01:16:48,149 --> 01:16:49,500
 Let's address the

287
01:16:49,500 --> 01:16:51,383
 first one, the voiceovers.

288
01:16:52,183 --> 01:16:54,283
 So the voiceovers is

289
01:16:54,283 --> 01:16:57,366
 impossible for you not to find.

290
01:16:58,016 --> 01:16:58,583
 Impossible.

291
01:16:59,399 --> 01:17:02,066
 Because what I'm doing is I put the

292
01:17:02,066 --> 01:17:04,250
 voiceovers onto post-its.

293
01:17:05,050 --> 01:17:09,250
 And I read the post-its, A1, it starts

294
01:17:09,250 --> 01:17:13,833
 here and goes to a transition line.

295
01:17:14,116 --> 01:17:16,883
 It says, now let's look at our targets.

296
01:17:17,500 --> 01:17:19,333
 If you are able to follow the Kamba,

297
01:17:19,750 --> 01:17:23,550
 either on Kamba.com or on the storyboard

298
01:17:23,550 --> 01:17:27,966
 video that I gave you, by scene number,

299
01:17:27,966 --> 01:17:30,483
 then you will be able to find it.

300
01:17:30,866 --> 01:17:36,816
 So the thing is, the post-production team

301
01:17:36,816 --> 01:17:45,533
 has S5, S6, all of

302
01:17:45,533 --> 01:17:47,066
 them next to each other.

303
01:17:47,833 --> 01:17:50,550
 I tried to find it.

304
01:17:50,550 --> 01:17:51,149
 I find it.

305
01:17:51,366 --> 01:17:53,883
 I'm able to because I read these things

306
01:17:53,883 --> 01:17:57,550
 and I put the audio under them, but not

307
01:17:57,550 --> 01:17:59,399
 one-to-one, but very,

308
01:17:59,399 --> 01:18:00,933
 very close to each other.

309
01:18:01,449 --> 01:18:03,266
 There is a cut, there is a start.

310
01:18:03,583 --> 01:18:05,449
 There is a cut, there is a start.

311
01:18:05,883 --> 01:18:07,633
 There is a cut, there is a start.

312
01:18:07,633 --> 01:18:10,583
 They are not 100%, but there

313
01:18:10,583 --> 01:18:11,783
 is a cut, there is a start.

314
01:18:11,816 --> 01:18:15,983
 So if I take it here and if I play it, I

315
01:18:15,983 --> 01:18:18,949
 will be able to hear attack, we apply

316
01:18:18,949 --> 01:18:20,050
 perturbation, we

317
01:18:20,050 --> 01:18:21,366
 aren't changing the image.

318
01:18:21,683 --> 01:18:24,533
 If I hit, I will play, I will hear

319
01:18:24,533 --> 01:18:26,616
 visuals, adversarial

320
01:18:26,616 --> 01:18:28,766
 samples, they are looking similar.

321
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,083
 I'm not going to talk like yourself.

322
01:18:31,449 --> 01:18:32,866
 I will talk about one

323
01:18:32,866 --> 01:18:34,583
 topic, then go to the other one.

324
01:18:34,966 --> 01:18:37,250
 Please answer what is the issue here.

325
01:18:39,850 --> 01:18:40,666
 How do you can get?

326
01:18:41,766 --> 01:18:42,449
 Yeah, yeah.

327
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:43,183
 Yeah.

328
01:18:43,183 --> 01:18:43,350
 Yeah.

329
01:18:43,350 --> 01:18:45,449
 So this one, I got it that one.

330
01:18:45,449 --> 01:18:46,383
 So we can understand it.

331
01:18:47,399 --> 01:18:50,066
 So we can fix this one as you are giving

332
01:18:50,066 --> 01:18:52,250
 the audio in that story about itself.

333
01:18:52,666 --> 01:18:54,666
 So right now we have the problem is if

334
01:18:54,666 --> 01:18:57,483
 you go to slide five, so the audio it is

335
01:18:57,483 --> 01:18:59,833
 coming up to slide six, it is coming.

336
01:19:00,149 --> 01:19:01,066
 Yeah, then cut it.

337
01:19:01,550 --> 01:19:02,133
 Just go to.

338
01:19:02,533 --> 01:19:03,350
 Then cut it.

339
01:19:03,350 --> 01:19:03,550
 Yeah.

340
01:19:04,550 --> 01:19:05,616
 I gave it to you.

341
01:19:06,149 --> 01:19:06,350
 Yeah.

342
01:19:06,383 --> 01:19:06,899
 Cut it then.

343
01:19:07,783 --> 01:19:10,466
 I understand this talks on limitations on

344
01:19:10,466 --> 01:19:12,733
 here and this talks on the environment.

345
01:19:13,050 --> 01:19:18,983
 This is not a simple cut, but cut it.

346
01:19:19,266 --> 01:19:20,533
 I put them over here.

347
01:19:21,133 --> 01:19:23,166
 So when I say the environment, we have to

348
01:19:23,166 --> 01:19:25,766
 decide you are going to see the images

349
01:19:25,766 --> 01:19:27,683
 here and you are going to see

350
01:19:27,683 --> 01:19:30,399
 the video and I can try you.

351
01:19:30,850 --> 01:19:31,033
 Yeah.

352
01:19:31,266 --> 01:19:31,466
 Yeah.

353
01:19:31,649 --> 01:19:32,933
 After the slide five, we can make a cut

354
01:19:32,933 --> 01:19:34,566
 and we can move the remaining part and

355
01:19:34,566 --> 01:19:35,983
 from slide six, we can

356
01:19:35,983 --> 01:19:36,750
 match the audio part.

357
01:19:36,783 --> 01:19:37,399
 So that is fine.

358
01:19:37,899 --> 01:19:38,116
 Yes.

359
01:19:38,399 --> 01:19:41,000
 So I gave you again, I can I give you

360
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:42,383
 that and I can share that one.

361
01:19:42,616 --> 01:19:42,816
 Yes.

362
01:19:43,083 --> 01:19:45,883
 I gave you three, four things on here.

363
01:19:46,483 --> 01:19:48,766
 First of all, the voiceover is a

364
01:19:48,766 --> 01:19:52,500
 screenshot in an image, a video to place

365
01:19:52,500 --> 01:19:57,149
 it over and also extra visuals for you to

366
01:19:57,149 --> 01:19:59,366
 go ahead, download and

367
01:19:59,366 --> 01:20:01,350
 make more sense out of it.

368
01:20:01,850 --> 01:20:04,666
 So you will be able to say, okay, Rufat

369
01:20:04,666 --> 01:20:07,149
 is talking about this and I

370
01:20:07,149 --> 01:20:08,666
 know what he is talking about.

371
01:20:09,233 --> 01:20:11,683
 Maybe I should show this image, show this

372
01:20:11,683 --> 01:20:14,750
 one or show this video that you will be

373
01:20:14,750 --> 01:20:17,083
 able to do either one of them.

374
01:20:17,399 --> 01:20:20,566
 So is the point one clear or this is

375
01:20:20,566 --> 01:20:22,333
 still too hard for you

376
01:20:22,333 --> 01:20:23,966
 guys to map and take?

377
01:20:24,866 --> 01:20:26,866
 See no, no, no, see, see, yeah.

378
01:20:27,449 --> 01:20:31,066
 I think the audio part, Hari can fix but

379
01:20:31,066 --> 01:20:32,966
 my concern is if you go to the slide one,

380
01:20:33,383 --> 01:20:34,683
 I'll give you, I'll tell you the example

381
01:20:34,683 --> 01:20:35,666
 of what I'm talking about.

382
01:20:35,966 --> 01:20:37,266
 When I say things are not in syncy,

383
01:20:38,316 --> 01:20:39,366
 whatever you're mentioning in the

384
01:20:39,366 --> 01:20:41,533
 narration, right, it clearly does not

385
01:20:41,533 --> 01:20:42,783
 discuss everything that is present.

386
01:20:42,816 --> 01:20:43,550
 This isn't on the scale.

387
01:20:43,883 --> 01:20:44,083
 Okay.

388
01:20:44,216 --> 01:20:44,716
 Of course.

389
01:20:44,716 --> 01:20:44,983
 Well, here you

390
01:20:44,983 --> 01:20:46,316
 mentioned the objectives, right?

391
01:20:46,633 --> 01:20:47,133
 Of course.

392
01:20:47,916 --> 01:20:48,366
 Just give me a second.

393
01:20:48,383 --> 01:20:52,733
 This is a moot board and a storyboard for

394
01:20:52,733 --> 01:20:55,983
 you to show what is up, but

395
01:20:55,983 --> 01:20:58,683
 I'm reading the posted notes.

396
01:20:59,566 --> 01:21:01,183
 I read the posted notes.

397
01:21:01,833 --> 01:21:02,566
 Wait, wait.

398
01:21:03,033 --> 01:21:06,266
 I read the posted notes explaining what

399
01:21:06,266 --> 01:21:09,883
 is here with a transition line.

400
01:21:10,383 --> 01:21:12,233
 So there is always a flow.

401
01:21:12,783 --> 01:21:15,783
 Which answers your second question?

402
01:21:18,933 --> 01:21:20,266
 Okay, just give me a second.

403
01:21:20,266 --> 01:21:22,333
 So over here, you're saying in the

404
01:21:22,333 --> 01:21:23,783
 narration, you're saying welcome to the

405
01:21:23,783 --> 01:21:25,316
 Evasion Attacks Lab.

406
01:21:25,500 --> 01:21:26,350
 Today our objectives

407
01:21:26,350 --> 01:21:27,816
 is simple but dangerous.

408
01:21:28,316 --> 01:21:30,166
 We are going to break a production ready

409
01:21:30,166 --> 01:21:31,283
 AI model using

410
01:21:31,283 --> 01:21:33,316
 nothing but math and noise.

411
01:21:33,316 --> 01:21:35,033
 So this is there in your voiceover.

412
01:21:35,533 --> 01:21:37,933
 But over here on screen, I can say KR1

413
01:21:37,933 --> 01:21:41,433
 reproducibility, then KR2.

414
01:21:41,466 --> 01:21:43,250
 So this is code clarity.

415
01:21:43,633 --> 01:21:45,466
 So these things are not mentioned.

416
01:21:46,166 --> 01:21:47,983
 This is not mentioned or this is not

417
01:21:47,983 --> 01:21:49,316
 talked about in the narration, the

418
01:21:49,316 --> 01:21:50,083
 corresponding narration.

419
01:21:50,350 --> 01:21:53,050
 So what we are going to do is, I'm

420
01:21:53,050 --> 01:21:55,366
 telling you what we are going to do is

421
01:21:55,766 --> 01:21:58,966
 show a big picture of your objective is

422
01:21:58,966 --> 01:22:00,149
 simple and dangerous.

423
01:22:00,716 --> 01:22:03,283
 Break your production ready model using

424
01:22:03,283 --> 01:22:04,966
 nothing but math and noise.

425
01:22:05,183 --> 01:22:06,933
 So that's my voiceover.

426
01:22:07,250 --> 01:22:09,000
 I'm going to go ahead and

427
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:10,500
 do all these objectives.

428
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:11,899
 I'm not taking

429
01:22:11,899 --> 01:22:14,216
 everything from this image.

430
01:22:14,633 --> 01:22:16,649
 This image is a storyboard.

431
01:22:16,649 --> 01:22:19,433
 You can use it, you might not use it.

432
01:22:20,283 --> 01:22:22,750
 So this is a storyboard image.

433
01:22:23,183 --> 01:22:25,466
 You can use the math and noise.

434
01:22:25,933 --> 01:22:29,283
 You can use the Evasion Attack Labs as a

435
01:22:29,283 --> 01:22:31,033
 big image that is coming

436
01:22:31,033 --> 01:22:33,733
 on here, but not everything.

437
01:22:33,733 --> 01:22:35,649
 You do not have to use everything.

438
01:22:35,866 --> 01:22:37,116
 This is a storyboard.

439
01:22:38,933 --> 01:22:40,949
 All of these images, it includes.

440
01:22:40,966 --> 01:22:43,366
 Once I go here, our first

441
01:22:43,366 --> 01:22:44,883
 key is the environmental.

442
01:22:45,350 --> 01:22:47,783
 We will deploy a fully reproducible.

443
01:22:48,050 --> 01:22:51,666
 Attackers Playbook repository for FGSM,

444
01:22:51,666 --> 01:22:53,283
 which is the hello world.

445
01:22:53,633 --> 01:22:54,833
 It says the hello world.

446
01:22:54,833 --> 01:22:56,483
 This is not going to be used.

447
01:22:56,866 --> 01:22:58,433
 What I'm doing is I

448
01:22:58,433 --> 01:23:00,683
 created the flow first.

449
01:23:01,550 --> 01:23:04,616
 My goal, Honuki, the main

450
01:23:04,616 --> 01:23:06,216
 goal is creating the flow.

451
01:23:06,533 --> 01:23:08,850
 I created objectives first.

452
01:23:09,750 --> 01:23:11,683
 Then I created an environment.

453
01:23:12,266 --> 01:23:14,683
 So the person has an environment.

454
01:23:15,250 --> 01:23:17,449
 Then I created the user interfaces.

455
01:23:18,166 --> 01:23:21,083
 Then I created all the formulas, all the

456
01:23:21,083 --> 01:23:23,149
 steps that they are going to follow.

457
01:23:23,366 --> 01:23:25,116
 Then I created all the

458
01:23:25,116 --> 01:23:26,550
 symbols that are used.

459
01:23:26,550 --> 01:23:29,583
 They are using AI to install the symbols.

460
01:23:29,983 --> 01:23:31,666
 Then I showed them the errors.

461
01:23:31,666 --> 01:23:33,000
 Then I showed them how

462
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:34,399
 they are going to test it.

463
01:23:34,399 --> 01:23:36,000
 So there is two flows.

464
01:23:36,550 --> 01:23:40,050
 There is one flow inside the narration.

465
01:23:40,866 --> 01:23:42,350
 There is the second flow

466
01:23:42,350 --> 01:23:44,733
 going through the one slide.

467
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:45,649
 There is the other slide

468
01:23:45,649 --> 01:23:48,000
 and there is an overall flow.

469
01:23:48,366 --> 01:23:49,366
 Yeah, that is understood.

470
01:23:50,683 --> 01:23:52,750
 My concern is only...

471
01:23:53,716 --> 01:23:54,633
 That are already

472
01:23:54,633 --> 01:23:56,633
 being designed and placed.

473
01:23:58,433 --> 01:23:59,333
 See, I understand.

474
01:23:59,333 --> 01:24:00,949
 See, there are transitions

475
01:24:00,949 --> 01:24:02,500
 from one slide to the other slide.

476
01:24:02,716 --> 01:24:03,616
 That is completely there.

477
01:24:04,066 --> 01:24:05,316
 I'm not denying that fact.

478
01:24:05,316 --> 01:24:08,833
 My concern is like I already said, you

479
01:24:08,833 --> 01:24:09,899
 have provided some images.

480
01:24:10,216 --> 01:24:12,216
 So the video which I have received is the

481
01:24:12,216 --> 01:24:15,149
 final produced video is the video that

482
01:24:15,149 --> 01:24:16,066
 contains all these images

483
01:24:16,066 --> 01:24:17,350
 along with the voiceover.

484
01:24:17,933 --> 01:24:19,783
 And if we include all the information

485
01:24:19,783 --> 01:24:21,166
 that you provided in the slides...

486
01:24:21,816 --> 01:24:22,633
 Not all the information.

487
01:24:23,233 --> 01:24:24,983
 No, no, no, no, no.

488
01:24:24,983 --> 01:24:26,383
 I said you guys are going to

489
01:24:26,383 --> 01:24:27,949
 do editing post-production.

490
01:24:28,533 --> 01:24:29,666
 Not all of the information.

491
01:24:29,899 --> 01:24:30,500
 You are not going to

492
01:24:30,500 --> 01:24:32,783
 include this title all the time.

493
01:24:33,283 --> 01:24:34,149
 You are not going to

494
01:24:34,149 --> 01:24:36,066
 include this image all the time.

495
01:24:36,283 --> 01:24:38,116
 You are not going to include this

496
01:24:38,116 --> 01:24:41,266
 post-node scene number as an editor.

497
01:24:41,816 --> 01:24:43,399
 But I can edit it with the

498
01:24:43,399 --> 01:24:45,449
 footage that I have provided.

499
01:24:45,966 --> 01:24:46,899
 You are going to listen.

500
01:24:47,333 --> 01:24:50,616
 You are going to see and then edit

501
01:24:50,616 --> 01:24:52,783
 something and create another...

502
01:24:52,933 --> 01:24:55,500
 storyline which lines up with audience

503
01:24:55,500 --> 01:24:58,949
 such as in here what I say for example

504
01:24:58,966 --> 01:25:01,649
 macOS users you are going to show them

505
01:25:01,649 --> 01:25:04,583
 MacBook and one M2 chips you are going to

506
01:25:04,583 --> 01:25:07,466
 show and one M2 chips often facing

507
01:25:07,466 --> 01:25:10,233
 TensorFlow capability you are going to

508
01:25:10,233 --> 01:25:13,133
 show TensorFlow I am showing the download

509
01:25:13,133 --> 01:25:16,050
 on here might not have the visual studio

510
01:25:16,050 --> 01:25:19,050
 code this part is the visual studio code

511
01:25:19,050 --> 01:25:23,466
 if you want I can also give those images

512
01:25:23,466 --> 01:25:27,333
 on here but I understand that you guys

513
01:25:27,333 --> 01:25:31,483
 find this am I correct that's the

514
01:25:31,483 --> 01:25:35,066
 challenge basically Rifat that yeah so

515
01:25:35,066 --> 01:25:37,250
 basically as in like you are the subject

516
01:25:37,250 --> 01:25:39,366
 matter expert the way you know the

517
01:25:39,366 --> 01:25:43,283
 content like it we won't be able to

518
01:25:43,283 --> 01:25:45,683
 exactly pick up which ones which parts to

519
01:25:45,683 --> 01:25:48,733
 use and which parts to not use like will

520
01:25:48,733 --> 01:25:50,500
 it be very difficult for you to provide

521
01:25:50,500 --> 01:25:53,716
 us the demo because that way we will we

522
01:25:53,716 --> 01:25:55,333
 will be able to meet Korsera's

523
01:25:55,333 --> 01:25:58,216
 expectation to to use demonstration

524
01:25:58,350 --> 01:26:02,000
 instead of images and your work and our

525
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:05,233
 work also I didn't only put images hold

526
01:26:05,233 --> 01:26:08,550
 on hold on we are mixing I also put the

527
01:26:08,550 --> 01:26:12,750
 videos and I gave you 10 different videos

528
01:26:12,750 --> 01:26:17,233
 on here with all the hand zones I gave

529
01:26:17,233 --> 01:26:19,816
 you guys the screen captures and the

530
01:26:19,816 --> 01:26:23,033
 videos the audience knows what they are

531
01:26:23,033 --> 01:26:25,766
 going to do you guys have images sound

532
01:26:25,766 --> 01:26:31,466
 videos and the flow on post-production go

533
01:26:31,466 --> 01:26:35,166
 ahead sir we are facing the problem here

534
01:26:35,166 --> 01:26:37,283
 so if we sound in some slides you have

535
01:26:37,283 --> 01:26:39,766
 included images and the videos also so

536
01:26:39,766 --> 01:26:42,616
 when it comes to for this audio first we

537
01:26:42,616 --> 01:26:44,449
 have to show the image or first we have

538
01:26:44,449 --> 01:26:47,433
 to show the video photos so that editors

539
01:26:47,433 --> 01:26:52,149
 are facing the that issue so from exactly

540
01:26:52,149 --> 01:26:55,733
 we have to show which one anyway first we

541
01:26:55,733 --> 01:26:56,666
 have to show the video or

542
01:26:56,666 --> 01:26:57,733
 first we have to show the image

543
01:26:57,816 --> 01:26:59,583
 This was that doubt we are having.

544
01:27:00,216 --> 01:27:02,466
 So do you guys want me to write to you

545
01:27:02,466 --> 01:27:06,666
 guys a post-production plan on here, how

546
01:27:06,666 --> 01:27:08,649
 you guys are going to edit it?

547
01:27:09,066 --> 01:27:11,566
 No, no, that'll even, that'll add one

548
01:27:11,566 --> 01:27:14,500
 more layer to, one more layer to the

549
01:27:14,500 --> 01:27:17,483
 already, there are too many layers right

550
01:27:17,483 --> 01:27:19,050
 now at this screen share.

551
01:27:19,533 --> 01:27:21,550
 The best and the easiest and the most

552
01:27:21,550 --> 01:27:23,983
 effective way would be, guys, please tell

553
01:27:23,983 --> 01:27:25,083
 me if I'm wrong, if you

554
01:27:25,083 --> 01:27:26,333
 record the demo for us.

555
01:27:27,466 --> 01:27:28,850
 I recorded the demo.

556
01:27:28,850 --> 01:27:29,716
 Exactly, of course I love the models.

557
01:27:29,716 --> 01:27:31,050
 These are the recorded demos.

558
01:27:32,149 --> 01:27:34,183
 These are the recorded demos I gave.

559
01:27:34,316 --> 01:27:34,949
 Okay, the first.

560
01:27:35,766 --> 01:27:40,116
 Tense screen capture videos and put them

561
01:27:40,116 --> 01:27:41,350
 onto the mood board.

562
01:27:41,350 --> 01:27:44,649
 But for us to be able to reach here, I'm

563
01:27:44,649 --> 01:27:46,816
 talking beforehand, before

564
01:27:46,816 --> 01:27:48,866
 this slide, it says environment.

565
01:27:49,266 --> 01:27:50,116
 Let's talk about the

566
01:27:50,116 --> 01:27:51,716
 environment to run these attacks.

567
01:27:52,283 --> 01:27:54,883
 We need a setup that supports a Python

568
01:27:54,883 --> 01:27:57,083
 library, such as TensorFlow image

569
01:27:57,083 --> 01:27:59,833
 processing without crashing your laptop.

570
01:28:00,383 --> 01:28:01,616
 But here is your constraint.

571
01:28:02,350 --> 01:28:04,733
 I'm talking about this, showing them the

572
01:28:04,733 --> 01:28:08,033
 TensorFlow install, then taking them to

573
01:28:08,033 --> 01:28:11,883
 here, local setups, open face, hell-rung

574
01:28:11,883 --> 01:28:13,949
 Python versions, missing libraries.

575
01:28:14,649 --> 01:28:16,649
 I'm showing them the GitHub code space.

576
01:28:18,216 --> 01:28:19,983
 Yeah, yeah, I referred, I'm asking so far

577
01:28:19,983 --> 01:28:22,216
 this slide five, if we have to, for this

578
01:28:22,216 --> 01:28:23,633
 audio, we have to

579
01:28:23,633 --> 01:28:25,250
 show only the video part.

580
01:28:26,316 --> 01:28:27,783
 No, video and image.

581
01:28:27,783 --> 01:28:28,649
 You have two images also.

582
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:30,183
 No, no, video and image.

583
01:28:30,216 --> 01:28:31,183
 So that also we have to show.

584
01:28:31,183 --> 01:28:32,083
 We have to show the image.

585
01:28:32,116 --> 01:28:37,899
 But is it so that when you are-- Only we

586
01:28:37,899 --> 01:28:38,949
 are having the issue.

587
01:28:39,283 --> 01:28:40,949
 So where exactly where we have to show

588
01:28:40,949 --> 01:28:41,866
 the image and where we

589
01:28:41,866 --> 01:28:43,033
 have to show the video.

590
01:28:43,033 --> 01:28:44,583
 So that confusion we are having.

591
01:28:45,750 --> 01:28:49,616
 If you guys want, I already gave you guys

592
01:28:49,616 --> 01:28:51,133
 all the storyboards.

593
01:28:51,899 --> 01:28:55,533
 I can also provide the edited version,

594
01:28:56,733 --> 01:28:59,816
 post-production version of this video and

595
01:28:59,816 --> 01:29:02,233
 show you guys how I edit it.

596
01:29:02,816 --> 01:29:04,449
 I can also edit this and

597
01:29:04,449 --> 01:29:06,500
 also write the post-production.

598
01:29:07,050 --> 01:29:09,033
 Then you can take it and understand,

599
01:29:09,266 --> 01:29:11,783
 okay, this is end-to-end where the image

600
01:29:11,783 --> 01:29:14,283
 comes in, where the audio comes in.

601
01:29:14,283 --> 01:29:16,133
 I can also do that in the

602
01:29:16,133 --> 01:29:18,550
 post-production, but I will finish all

603
01:29:18,550 --> 01:29:19,816
 the post-production edit.

604
01:29:22,633 --> 01:29:24,783
 No, no, actually post-production, our

605
01:29:24,783 --> 01:29:26,566
 team can handle, that's not a problem,

606
01:29:26,933 --> 01:29:29,183
 but wouldn't it be easier for you to

607
01:29:29,183 --> 01:29:31,350
 record the demo than to edit everything?

608
01:29:31,483 --> 01:29:34,683
 Swati, I think the issue here is that the

609
01:29:34,683 --> 01:29:37,216
 demo is recorded, like those videos that

610
01:29:37,216 --> 01:29:38,216
 are embedded are the

611
01:29:38,216 --> 01:29:39,250
 hands-on demo, right?

612
01:29:39,816 --> 01:29:41,899
 Yes. That are there, that comes in parts.

613
01:29:42,383 --> 01:29:43,750
 But there is a part of

614
01:29:43,750 --> 01:29:47,116
 voiceover which needs to have

615
01:29:48,366 --> 01:29:51,000
 our developed slides, like in the

616
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,133
 beginning, like we were talking about Mac

617
01:29:53,133 --> 01:29:55,583
 and whatever, then we put up a Mac image

618
01:29:55,583 --> 01:29:57,683
 or whatsoever, that part we have to do.

619
01:29:57,683 --> 01:30:00,183
 And then for the current slide, there is

620
01:30:00,183 --> 01:30:02,233
 a portion of the image that comes first,

621
01:30:02,466 --> 01:30:03,949
 then the demo plays, the

622
01:30:03,949 --> 01:30:04,899
 image that is attached.

623
01:30:05,533 --> 01:30:07,316
 Rifat, am I right on this part?

624
01:30:08,333 --> 01:30:11,250
 Yes, but what I'm thinking is right now,

625
01:30:11,566 --> 01:30:13,783
 how they are looking at it is without

626
01:30:13,783 --> 01:30:17,483
 putting the cognitive part, they just

627
01:30:17,483 --> 01:30:20,283
 want to be able to, I also understand,

628
01:30:20,750 --> 01:30:21,933
 this is an advanced

629
01:30:21,933 --> 01:30:24,166
 course, not an easy course.

630
01:30:24,649 --> 01:30:27,949
 So what I can do is, I can use the

631
01:30:27,949 --> 01:30:31,766
 footages that I gave you guys, finish one

632
01:30:31,766 --> 01:30:33,833
 video's edit, because there is going to

633
01:30:33,833 --> 01:30:37,866
 be 10 modules, and show you guys the plan

634
01:30:37,866 --> 01:30:41,733
 and how I edited it, and only use the

635
01:30:41,733 --> 01:30:44,933
 files that I've given you guys, and also

636
01:30:44,933 --> 01:30:47,616
 find MacBook images and do the

637
01:30:47,616 --> 01:30:51,716
 placements, and it will be easier for you

638
01:30:51,716 --> 01:30:54,133
 guys, which steps I have gone through,

639
01:30:54,133 --> 01:30:55,283
 because there is

640
01:30:55,283 --> 01:30:56,899
 three stages of the flow.

641
01:30:57,399 --> 01:31:00,149
 One flow with the audio, one flow within

642
01:31:00,149 --> 01:31:04,233
 all video structure, and one flow with

643
01:31:04,233 --> 01:31:07,183
 the artifacts inside the scenes.

644
01:31:07,816 --> 01:31:10,083
 I think what you guys are having an issue

645
01:31:10,083 --> 01:31:13,383
 is, I did not include the artifacts

646
01:31:13,383 --> 01:31:15,233
 inside the scenes flow.

647
01:31:15,533 --> 01:31:17,683
 You guys are unable to place them.

648
01:31:17,966 --> 01:31:19,566
 Did I understand it correctly?

649
01:31:19,966 --> 01:31:23,133
 I gave you guys the title, I gave you

650
01:31:23,133 --> 01:31:25,783
 guys the voiceover, I gave you guys the

651
01:31:25,783 --> 01:31:29,483
 videos and the images, but I did not give

652
01:31:29,483 --> 01:31:31,266
 you guys how it is flowing.

653
01:31:32,083 --> 01:31:34,933
 So it is creating a hard time because you

654
01:31:34,933 --> 01:31:37,050
 guys are not subject matter experts.

655
01:31:37,683 --> 01:31:40,833
 Which one you guys are going to show and

656
01:31:40,833 --> 01:31:43,449
 you guys are unable to make the decision

657
01:31:43,449 --> 01:31:46,233
 on what to show, what not to show.

658
01:31:48,250 --> 01:31:50,033
 Yeah, exactly that is the point.

659
01:31:50,716 --> 01:31:53,483
 Now, even if you'll edit one video, when

660
01:31:53,483 --> 01:31:55,383
 we come to the next one, how will we

661
01:31:55,383 --> 01:31:57,466
 again understand what has to come with?

662
01:31:58,816 --> 01:31:59,949
 So the question is how

663
01:31:59,949 --> 01:32:01,583
 we as laymen understand.

664
01:32:02,583 --> 01:32:04,449
 First of all, once I finish the editing

665
01:32:04,449 --> 01:32:07,250
 of this video, I will have two things.

666
01:32:07,899 --> 01:32:09,149
 One, editing plan.

667
01:32:09,683 --> 01:32:11,850
 The second, an output that

668
01:32:11,850 --> 01:32:13,550
 I like that you guys like.

669
01:32:13,550 --> 01:32:16,000
 You guys can say, "I like this edit, I

670
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:16,933
 don't like this edit."

671
01:32:17,366 --> 01:32:20,233
 But we will also edit the edit plan.

672
01:32:20,233 --> 01:32:22,949
 Then you guys will say, "Okay, just give

673
01:32:22,949 --> 01:32:25,616
 me the edit plan in the next videos and

674
01:32:25,616 --> 01:32:27,566
 we will edit through this."

675
01:32:27,800 --> 01:32:31,250
 That edit plan will include artifact by

676
01:32:31,250 --> 01:32:36,833
 artifact, meaning this lower third will

677
01:32:36,833 --> 01:32:40,250
 come, this image will come, this screen

678
01:32:40,250 --> 01:32:43,233
 capture will come, and that output will

679
01:32:43,233 --> 01:32:46,583
 be at the output video capture that you

680
01:32:46,583 --> 01:32:48,250
 guys will be able to see.

681
01:32:48,250 --> 01:32:50,983
 Two outputs, one final video output and

682
01:32:50,983 --> 01:32:54,033
 then the planned video output.

683
01:32:54,550 --> 01:32:57,283
 So all of them will be in one video.

684
01:32:58,366 --> 01:33:02,216
 So, Rifat, then if that is the only

685
01:33:02,216 --> 01:33:05,233
 solution, Hano, please correct me if I'm

686
01:33:05,233 --> 01:33:06,983
 wrong and Sangya, please

687
01:33:06,983 --> 01:33:07,833
 correct me if I'm wrong.

688
01:33:08,250 --> 01:33:10,216
 So you don't have to edit exact thing,

689
01:33:10,466 --> 01:33:11,316
 just give us a rough

690
01:33:11,316 --> 01:33:12,783
 structure because I don't know.

691
01:33:12,816 --> 01:33:14,166
 want you to put in a lot of effort

692
01:33:14,166 --> 01:33:15,116
 because anyways we are

693
01:33:15,116 --> 01:33:16,133
 going to redo it here.

694
01:33:16,566 --> 01:33:18,399
 We have professional editors who do it.

695
01:33:18,783 --> 01:33:20,216
 So just give us a rough structure in

696
01:33:20,216 --> 01:33:21,350
 terms of so that it gives

697
01:33:21,350 --> 01:33:23,066
 us clarity what comes where.

698
01:33:23,666 --> 01:33:24,949
 I already gave the rough structure.

699
01:33:24,949 --> 01:33:25,883
 In a video if you can

700
01:33:25,883 --> 01:33:26,966
 give us the rough structure.

701
01:33:27,466 --> 01:33:29,216
 I already gave the rough structure.

702
01:33:29,216 --> 01:33:31,550
 But since it got very confusing since

703
01:33:31,550 --> 01:33:33,583
 they were canvas lights there were a lot

704
01:33:33,583 --> 01:33:35,750
 of confusion and mismatch of the audio.

705
01:33:36,500 --> 01:33:37,683
 So if that only you

706
01:33:37,683 --> 01:33:38,716
 can put it in a video.

707
01:33:38,716 --> 01:33:39,216
 No what I will do is.

708
01:33:39,216 --> 01:33:40,766
 Please correct me if I'm wrong.

709
01:33:40,766 --> 01:33:43,783
 I will edit this on DaVinci Resolve and

710
01:33:43,783 --> 01:33:46,666
 record myself while editing it.

711
01:33:47,433 --> 01:33:48,500
 So you guys will be

712
01:33:48,500 --> 01:33:50,966
 able to see how I edit it.

713
01:33:51,216 --> 01:33:52,933
 How I do my selections.

714
01:33:53,500 --> 01:33:55,816
 And to end with the plan.

715
01:33:56,399 --> 01:34:00,266
 So I will be like the video production

716
01:34:00,266 --> 01:34:02,649
 assistant on the editing side.

717
01:34:02,983 --> 01:34:03,899
 So it will be easier.

718
01:34:04,949 --> 01:34:07,983
 I think if we will see you like somewhere

719
01:34:07,983 --> 01:34:10,583
 in the screen on the screen that will be

720
01:34:10,583 --> 01:34:12,550
 a little problem because we would want to

721
01:34:12,550 --> 01:34:14,733
 have the full HD version of it.

722
01:34:15,033 --> 01:34:15,750
 No no I will give two of it.

723
01:34:15,750 --> 01:34:15,899
 And then definitely we

724
01:34:15,899 --> 01:34:17,449
 will find you that at our end.

725
01:34:17,449 --> 01:34:18,983
 I will give one video

726
01:34:18,983 --> 01:34:22,316
 output as the edited version.

727
01:34:22,866 --> 01:34:25,233
 The second I will give you guys the plan.

728
01:34:25,616 --> 01:34:28,766
 The third I will give you guys how I edit

729
01:34:28,766 --> 01:34:30,633
 it on DaVinci Resolve.

730
01:34:33,550 --> 01:34:34,433
 Is

731
01:34:37,066 --> 01:34:38,183
 that all right?

732
01:34:38,500 --> 01:34:45,449
 I think Swati is absolutely right.

733
01:34:45,449 --> 01:34:46,449
 I think this is causing

734
01:34:46,449 --> 01:34:47,933
 too much work for you for us.

735
01:34:48,716 --> 01:34:50,983
 And if we calculate the time that we are

736
01:34:50,983 --> 01:34:54,533
 taking for the review process itself it's

737
01:34:54,533 --> 01:34:56,466
 adding to a lot of time for this course.

738
01:34:57,033 --> 01:34:59,233
 So we want to simplify the process rather

739
01:34:59,233 --> 01:35:01,683
 than you investing so much time into it.

740
01:35:02,050 --> 01:35:03,466
 Because like you said time is money.

741
01:35:03,949 --> 01:35:05,783
 Let's do it that way.

742
01:35:05,783 --> 01:35:07,883
 So we don't want anybody to invest extra

743
01:35:07,883 --> 01:35:10,233
 effort into you know editing then us

744
01:35:10,233 --> 01:35:12,566
 viewing it and then going forward to it.

745
01:35:12,566 --> 01:35:13,149
 Although that is the

746
01:35:13,149 --> 01:35:15,050
 process of learning we'd say.

747
01:35:15,333 --> 01:35:17,783
 But as a business model I would say.

748
01:35:17,816 --> 01:35:19,899
 that we will have to be a little more

749
01:35:19,899 --> 01:35:21,899
 conscious on the time that we're

750
01:35:21,899 --> 01:35:24,966
 investing in one video

751
01:35:24,966 --> 01:35:27,066
 production of only one screen share.

752
01:35:28,933 --> 01:35:32,566
 If the easy way out, if it could be, was

753
01:35:32,566 --> 01:35:36,500
 that while, that is my idea of it.

754
01:35:36,500 --> 01:35:39,399
 Can you just put, like you put it on the

755
01:35:39,399 --> 01:35:42,566
 Canva board, you put every, this thing,

756
01:35:42,566 --> 01:35:45,116
 every line of your script and then given

757
01:35:45,116 --> 01:35:46,966
 us a video and a photo.

758
01:35:47,633 --> 01:35:49,250
 And it's all on one Canva.

759
01:35:49,250 --> 01:35:50,966
 So that is what is getting us confused.

760
01:35:51,366 --> 01:35:52,466
 I already gave my cover.

761
01:35:52,466 --> 01:35:53,633
 So rather than that, can you?

762
01:35:53,949 --> 01:35:57,566
 I already gave my cover and voiceover or

763
01:35:57,566 --> 01:36:00,050
 post it lost with scene IDs.

764
01:36:00,466 --> 01:36:02,283
 And the audio is very

765
01:36:02,283 --> 01:36:03,533
 close to the scenes.

766
01:36:06,250 --> 01:36:08,583
 So like in one of the, one slide, there

767
01:36:08,583 --> 01:36:10,483
 is an audio, there is an image and

768
01:36:10,483 --> 01:36:12,000
 there's a voiceover and then there's a

769
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:13,066
 script part of it, right?

770
01:36:13,566 --> 01:36:15,366
 Now all of that, where to

771
01:36:15,366 --> 01:36:16,966
 put what is the question here?

772
01:36:17,833 --> 01:36:19,266
 So to simplify that,

773
01:36:19,483 --> 01:36:21,050
 can we have a simple,

774
01:36:22,866 --> 01:36:27,033
 breakdown of the sentence that you're

775
01:36:27,033 --> 01:36:28,233
 speaking and what image you

776
01:36:28,233 --> 01:36:30,850
 want to get in front of it?

777
01:36:31,133 --> 01:36:31,716
 Just that much.

778
01:36:31,716 --> 01:36:32,750
 All right, you guys want the plan.

779
01:36:32,899 --> 01:36:33,583
 With this sentence, you

780
01:36:33,583 --> 01:36:34,750
 want this video to come in.

781
01:36:34,866 --> 01:36:37,766
 I will create the post production plan.

782
01:36:38,500 --> 01:36:40,133
 That post production plan is,

783
01:36:40,383 --> 01:36:41,733
 I have done it multiple times.

784
01:36:42,133 --> 01:36:43,133
 I will give you guys

785
01:36:43,133 --> 01:36:44,466
 the post production plan.

786
01:36:47,783 --> 01:36:50,983
 Where image, when the audio comes in, I

787
01:36:50,983 --> 01:36:52,066
 will give you guys the

788
01:36:52,066 --> 01:36:53,083
 post production plan.

789
01:36:53,333 --> 01:36:56,366
 It's not very, very hard because I have

790
01:36:56,366 --> 01:36:57,716
 the video, I have the audio.

791
01:36:58,233 --> 01:37:00,449
 I will go to chat GPT, create me a post

792
01:37:00,449 --> 01:37:03,133
 production plan and put it there so you

793
01:37:03,133 --> 01:37:06,366
 guys will be able to use the AI and see

794
01:37:06,366 --> 01:37:08,750
 there's a post production plan and the

795
01:37:08,750 --> 01:37:11,449
 post production plan will include all the

796
01:37:11,449 --> 01:37:13,149
 images, audio that

797
01:37:13,149 --> 01:37:14,816
 should be displayed on here.

798
01:37:14,816 --> 01:37:16,266
 I can definitely give that, yes.

799
01:37:17,216 --> 01:37:19,266
 And it will not take too much of my time.

800
01:37:19,766 --> 01:37:21,133
 And I will use the AI to

801
01:37:21,133 --> 01:37:22,783
 create the post production.

802
01:37:22,866 --> 01:37:25,750
 plan with the existing stuff that we

803
01:37:25,750 --> 01:37:27,683
 already have on the scene.

804
01:37:31,566 --> 01:37:32,983
 Okay, I just have one.

805
01:37:33,500 --> 01:37:36,066
 Yeah, I'll just tell one more thing.

806
01:37:36,066 --> 01:37:37,866
 See the thing over here is like if you're

807
01:37:37,866 --> 01:37:40,666
 switching in between a lot of images, a

808
01:37:40,666 --> 01:37:41,866
 lot of videos in between.

809
01:37:41,866 --> 01:37:43,216
 So I see that the

810
01:37:43,216 --> 01:37:45,233
 voiceover is not very long.

811
01:37:45,233 --> 01:37:45,550
 All right.

812
01:37:45,550 --> 01:37:47,783
 The corresponding narration, it's hardly

813
01:37:47,783 --> 01:37:49,483
 of two, three lines or so.

814
01:37:50,050 --> 01:37:51,666
 Okay, so there is not

815
01:37:51,666 --> 01:37:53,133
 enough settlement time.

816
01:37:54,666 --> 01:37:55,850
 Just give me a second.

817
01:37:55,850 --> 01:37:57,683
 So there is not enough settlement time

818
01:37:57,683 --> 01:37:59,533
 for the learner to kind of comprehend of

819
01:37:59,533 --> 01:38:00,616
 what comes on the screen.

820
01:38:01,083 --> 01:38:02,350
 Like I see there are a

821
01:38:02,350 --> 01:38:03,766
 lot of code snippets, right?

822
01:38:04,250 --> 01:38:05,833
 So there are a lot of codes involved.

823
01:38:06,083 --> 01:38:07,966
 Like if you say that, okay, for visual

824
01:38:07,966 --> 01:38:08,833
 studio code, we're

825
01:38:08,833 --> 01:38:09,983
 going to show this image.

826
01:38:10,500 --> 01:38:10,899
 All right.

827
01:38:10,899 --> 01:38:11,883
 So there are a lot of

828
01:38:11,883 --> 01:38:13,050
 codes involved in that.

829
01:38:14,083 --> 01:38:16,250
 So it would just come and go.

830
01:38:16,250 --> 01:38:17,716
 It would not add any learning

831
01:38:17,716 --> 01:38:18,966
 value for the learner, right?

832
01:38:19,333 --> 01:38:21,316
 So there is not enough time that we are

833
01:38:21,316 --> 01:38:22,966
 spending on that image, the different

834
01:38:22,966 --> 01:38:24,366
 codes that are written in that.

835
01:38:24,850 --> 01:38:26,899
 Like so, like it's very difficult from a

836
01:38:26,899 --> 01:38:28,166
 learner's perspective to kind of

837
01:38:28,166 --> 01:38:30,433
 understand what is written in that.

838
01:38:30,666 --> 01:38:31,183
 Hold on, hold on, hold on.

839
01:38:31,183 --> 01:38:32,366
 So that is what I meant

840
01:38:32,366 --> 01:38:33,716
 when things are not in secret.

841
01:38:33,983 --> 01:38:34,750
 Hold on, okay.

842
01:38:35,133 --> 01:38:35,733
 Don't forget.

843
01:38:36,050 --> 01:38:40,233
 This is, I compressed this video from,

844
01:38:41,683 --> 01:38:44,466
 this is right now at six, seven minutes,

845
01:38:44,750 --> 01:38:45,983
 once it's all edited

846
01:38:45,983 --> 01:38:48,449
 out, the, what's her name?

847
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:51,216
 The mom met once only three minutes.

848
01:38:51,766 --> 01:38:54,583
 This is an advanced course because we are

849
01:38:54,583 --> 01:38:56,033
 going to create 10 of them.

850
01:38:57,366 --> 01:38:58,666
 We are compressing them.

851
01:38:59,350 --> 01:39:01,366
 In the future, I will

852
01:39:01,366 --> 01:39:03,083
 even compress it further.

853
01:39:03,683 --> 01:39:06,166
 There is right now 40 scenes.

854
01:39:06,683 --> 01:39:08,233
 In my future ones, I will

855
01:39:08,233 --> 01:39:10,983
 only create 10 scenes, not 40.

856
01:39:11,850 --> 01:39:14,633
 This is an advanced level course, but we

857
01:39:14,633 --> 01:39:17,133
 are trying to fit into 60 minute

858
01:39:17,133 --> 01:39:19,316
 timeline, not six hours timeline.

859
01:39:20,966 --> 01:39:23,899
 Do you understand what I mean?

860
01:39:23,899 --> 01:39:25,683
 Yeah, so that is what, so

861
01:39:25,683 --> 01:39:27,183
 I completely understand.

862
01:39:27,933 --> 01:39:29,583
 trying to go fast.

863
01:39:30,399 --> 01:39:32,866
 If I shoot this in one go,

864
01:39:33,383 --> 01:39:35,233
 it will cost it one hour.

865
01:39:35,533 --> 01:39:36,833
 Then the mom mate will say

866
01:39:36,833 --> 01:39:38,899
 one video capture one hour.

867
01:39:39,116 --> 01:39:39,899
 What are you doing?

868
01:39:43,050 --> 01:39:43,466
 Do you understand?

869
01:39:44,583 --> 01:39:45,550
 Maybe what we can.

870
01:39:46,183 --> 01:39:46,783
 Yeah, I understand.

871
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:48,183
 See, like I'll tell you.

872
01:39:48,183 --> 01:39:49,733
 So if you go to them up,

873
01:39:51,533 --> 01:39:55,383
 don't forget I speeded up these voice

874
01:39:55,383 --> 01:39:58,166
 captures, the screen captures.

875
01:39:58,666 --> 01:40:00,750
 They are in 3x, 4x.

876
01:40:01,500 --> 01:40:04,316
 Don't forget such as once I go to these

877
01:40:04,316 --> 01:40:06,766
 videos, if you play them, you are going

878
01:40:06,766 --> 01:40:09,550
 to realize these are running very, very

879
01:40:09,550 --> 01:40:10,949
 fast and down below.

880
01:40:10,949 --> 01:40:12,449
 If we can't hear you, you're on mute.

881
01:40:13,050 --> 01:40:17,266
 Once if you look at these screen

882
01:40:17,266 --> 01:40:20,633
 captures, these are in 4x, 3x.

883
01:40:20,949 --> 01:40:23,683
 These ones are also going very fast.

884
01:40:24,066 --> 01:40:26,550
 Let's just take this as an example.

885
01:40:26,850 --> 01:40:29,133
 So let's see the voice over corresponding

886
01:40:29,250 --> 01:40:30,449
 to this particular screen.

887
01:40:30,449 --> 01:40:32,333
 Let's just review this slide.

888
01:40:32,666 --> 01:40:34,466
 I'll tell my observations on this.

889
01:40:34,833 --> 01:40:36,750
 Okay, you are saying you could start.

890
01:40:37,500 --> 01:40:38,383
 What's the voice over?

891
01:40:38,816 --> 01:40:43,116
 It's right up on Python 3 and the

892
01:40:43,116 --> 01:40:46,500
 connection status and we are live.

893
01:40:47,166 --> 01:40:47,899
 Time to run it.

894
01:40:48,166 --> 01:40:50,850
 I'm running it in the background and at

895
01:40:50,850 --> 01:40:53,716
 the end I'm going to see the Python 3

896
01:40:53,716 --> 01:40:55,483
 online that comes on here.

897
01:40:56,333 --> 01:40:58,616
 First of all, we asked the AI, artificial

898
01:40:58,616 --> 01:41:01,149
 intelligence, for us to run it.

899
01:41:01,433 --> 01:41:03,933
 This is the first thing that comes on.

900
01:41:03,933 --> 01:41:05,500
 Then there is this video

901
01:41:05,500 --> 01:41:07,566
 that shows Python that runs.

902
01:41:08,166 --> 01:41:10,316
 This is the start and this is the end.

903
01:41:12,166 --> 01:41:14,866
 And okay, so this is of how much time?

904
01:41:15,283 --> 01:41:16,166
 This screen share, this

905
01:41:16,166 --> 01:41:17,083
 is of how much duration?

906
01:41:18,050 --> 01:41:21,983
 Now see this screen share,

907
01:41:22,233 --> 01:41:23,083
 this is of how many seconds?

908
01:41:23,966 --> 01:41:25,949
 16 seconds, 16.7.

909
01:41:26,366 --> 01:41:26,899
 This is of screen.

910
01:41:27,716 --> 01:41:30,500
 And see the voice over is not enough.

911
01:41:30,766 --> 01:41:32,783
 There is a 16 seconds of

912
01:41:32,983 --> 01:41:35,883
 and then like you're saying and and and

913
01:41:35,883 --> 01:41:38,566
 it's very like if you could pull up the

914
01:41:38,566 --> 01:41:40,783
 voiceover corresponding to this which

915
01:41:40,783 --> 01:41:41,983
 which you have written.

916
01:41:44,033 --> 01:41:46,316
 See your journalist connected your right

917
01:41:46,316 --> 01:41:48,866
 up you will be able to see the Python 3

918
01:41:48,866 --> 01:41:53,166
 server ensure your kernel is yes and this

919
01:41:53,166 --> 01:41:55,733
 is where we show it.

920
01:41:55,733 --> 01:41:58,399
 This is going to be shown at the start we

921
01:41:58,399 --> 01:42:00,633
 run this you're saying in the top right

922
01:42:00,633 --> 01:42:02,783
 in the top right you should see Python

923
01:42:02,783 --> 01:42:04,933
 where can I see it on the top right?

924
01:42:05,666 --> 01:42:07,383
 It should be here on the point.

925
01:42:18,433 --> 01:42:19,566
 Python running here.

926
01:42:23,283 --> 01:42:25,666
 It says running type, right corner.

927
01:42:26,449 --> 01:42:27,116
 It's on the left.

928
01:42:27,466 --> 01:42:28,933
 So left.

929
01:42:30,283 --> 01:42:33,050
 OK, so the voiceover says see so see like

930
01:42:33,050 --> 01:42:34,933
 like we're just reviewing one slide.

931
01:42:35,166 --> 01:42:36,966
 So this is what so then the voiceover

932
01:42:36,966 --> 01:42:39,350
 says like as editors they do not know

933
01:42:39,350 --> 01:42:40,283
 where actually the

934
01:42:40,283 --> 01:42:41,383
 Python program is running.

935
01:42:41,883 --> 01:42:43,500
 So the voiceover says the learner would

936
01:42:43,500 --> 01:42:45,666
 be looking for where the Python program

937
01:42:45,666 --> 01:42:47,066
 is running because the narration says

938
01:42:47,066 --> 01:42:49,000
 that on the type top right corner there

939
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:50,250
 is this Python 3 running

940
01:42:50,250 --> 01:42:51,550
 like they would not be.

941
01:42:51,550 --> 01:42:52,633
 I'm just saying from a.

942
01:42:56,649 --> 01:42:59,233
 Editor's job is to

943
01:42:59,233 --> 01:43:01,783
 make sure this is usable.

944
01:43:03,333 --> 01:43:06,483
 Yes, I understand that editor's job is

945
01:43:06,483 --> 01:43:10,350
 thinking and making the best out of it.

946
01:43:11,050 --> 01:43:12,316
 Sometimes I read the same

947
01:43:12,316 --> 01:43:14,383
 sentence multiple times.

948
01:43:14,866 --> 01:43:17,750
 Editor's job is cut the ones that are not

949
01:43:17,750 --> 01:43:20,583
 going to get used and only use the one

950
01:43:20,583 --> 01:43:22,183
 that is going to be used.

951
01:43:22,566 --> 01:43:24,500
 But these are very technical.

952
01:43:25,166 --> 01:43:26,633
 They can understand like

953
01:43:26,633 --> 01:43:29,883
 what what is that we want to.

954
01:43:30,133 --> 01:43:31,866
 There are multiple things on the We want

955
01:43:31,866 --> 01:43:32,866
 to have your expertise.

956
01:43:34,550 --> 01:43:37,216
 So we delete the right.

957
01:43:37,833 --> 01:43:40,449
 Well, but they won't be able to...

958
01:43:40,933 --> 01:43:42,333
 No, no, that is easy or post-production.

959
01:43:42,333 --> 01:43:43,050
 What if something is deleted which is

960
01:43:43,050 --> 01:43:44,250
 very crucial as per you?

961
01:43:44,766 --> 01:43:46,649
 That is easy or post-production.

962
01:43:47,583 --> 01:43:48,983
 Delete the right keyword,

963
01:43:50,050 --> 01:43:51,633
 only use the top keyword.

964
01:43:51,949 --> 01:43:52,666
 It is easy.

965
01:43:53,383 --> 01:43:54,483
 You use your mind.

966
01:43:54,483 --> 01:43:55,899
 But they are not...

967
01:43:56,883 --> 01:43:59,833
 My post-production team is not refered.

968
01:44:00,566 --> 01:44:02,166
 They are not away from you.

969
01:44:02,633 --> 01:44:03,433
 So they won't be able

970
01:44:03,433 --> 01:44:04,816
 to know what to delete.

971
01:44:04,816 --> 01:44:06,283
 That is the struggle that we are facing.

972
01:44:07,616 --> 01:44:09,766
 I think we need to have you on a call

973
01:44:09,766 --> 01:44:11,166
 while we are editing.

974
01:44:11,166 --> 01:44:12,466
 You know, like what can we take?

975
01:44:12,850 --> 01:44:14,633
 Yes, let's edit together.

976
01:44:15,483 --> 01:44:15,683
 Okay.

977
01:44:16,250 --> 01:44:18,449
 Hanoi, I will connect to you.

978
01:44:18,933 --> 01:44:20,233
 We can edit together.

979
01:44:20,233 --> 01:44:21,083
 That's also fine.

980
01:44:21,983 --> 01:44:22,949
 I can help you edit.

981
01:44:23,149 --> 01:44:24,183
 I do not do editing.

982
01:44:24,449 --> 01:44:26,266
 Like I just reviewed the final video.

983
01:44:27,083 --> 01:44:28,783
 I just reviewed the final video.

984
01:44:28,783 --> 01:44:31,166
 So I'm not part of editing, no?

985
01:44:31,399 --> 01:44:33,133
 So I'm not involved in that process.

986
01:44:33,883 --> 01:44:35,500
 I get the final video for reviewing.

987
01:44:35,966 --> 01:44:37,666
 Okay, one last thing, one more thing.

988
01:44:37,666 --> 01:44:39,866
 So there is one more line which you said,

989
01:44:40,183 --> 01:44:42,433
 "ensure the kernel is connected," right?

990
01:44:42,933 --> 01:44:44,316
 So for that, you're saying

991
01:44:44,316 --> 01:44:46,433
 there is a 16 seconds of demo.

992
01:44:47,833 --> 01:44:50,149
 Now, where is that process?

993
01:44:50,483 --> 01:44:52,116
 Like how would the learner ensure?

994
01:44:53,033 --> 01:44:54,316
 But you're actually showing...

995
01:44:54,816 --> 01:44:56,366
 So I think the narration

996
01:44:56,366 --> 01:44:57,850
 should be in a different way.

997
01:44:58,966 --> 01:45:01,000
 Maybe see, this is how you

998
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:02,616
 would have to connect the kernel.

999
01:45:03,133 --> 01:45:05,449
 You have that 16 seconds of demo.

1000
01:45:05,833 --> 01:45:06,933
 Correct me if I'm right or wrong.

1001
01:45:07,183 --> 01:45:09,000
 Because see, it's very difficult for the

1002
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:10,949
 learner to comprehend like how are they

1003
01:45:10,949 --> 01:45:12,000
 actually connecting the

1004
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,183
 kernel, how they should ensure it.

1005
01:45:14,783 --> 01:45:16,616
 Unless and until if you have shown it and

1006
01:45:16,616 --> 01:45:18,750
 there is a corresponding voiceover to

1007
01:45:18,750 --> 01:45:19,766
 that, they will not

1008
01:45:19,766 --> 01:45:20,666
 be able to understand.

1009
01:45:20,899 --> 01:45:21,883
 So that is what I'm saying.

1010
01:45:22,466 --> 01:45:22,750
 So I...

1011
01:45:23,166 --> 01:45:23,983
 So this is good though.

1012
01:45:24,466 --> 01:45:27,816
 But I will do, if I was your position, I

1013
01:45:27,816 --> 01:45:30,750
 will create a three second animation and

1014
01:45:30,750 --> 01:45:34,666
 put a kernel connected message on top and

1015
01:45:34,666 --> 01:45:36,833
 give it and amplify it.

1016
01:45:37,083 --> 01:45:39,083
 So they understand that the kernel

1017
01:45:39,083 --> 01:45:41,733
 connection is very, very important.

1018
01:45:47,149 --> 01:45:48,399
 Did you hear me?

1019
01:45:50,750 --> 01:45:51,966
 Yeah, I heard you.

1020
01:45:53,100 --> 01:45:54,316
 Yes, so that's why

1021
01:45:54,316 --> 01:45:55,516
 people use the animation.

1022
01:45:56,333 --> 01:45:58,083
 But we have a limited budget.

1023
01:45:58,800 --> 01:46:01,416
 We have limited time because we cannot

1024
01:46:01,416 --> 01:46:02,833
 shoot this for one hour.

1025
01:46:03,033 --> 01:46:03,899
 It's a screen capture.

1026
01:46:04,233 --> 01:46:05,066
 That's our constraint.

1027
01:46:05,649 --> 01:46:07,116
 But we need to have a

1028
01:46:07,116 --> 01:46:09,366
 structure that creates this.

1029
01:46:09,883 --> 01:46:12,800
 We need to have screen captures and we

1030
01:46:12,800 --> 01:46:13,583
 have 10 different

1031
01:46:13,583 --> 01:46:15,083
 tools that goes in and out.

1032
01:46:15,100 --> 01:46:19,333
 So we use the post-production magic to be

1033
01:46:19,333 --> 01:46:20,649
 able to make this work.

1034
01:46:21,199 --> 01:46:22,333
 That is the whole game.

1035
01:46:22,883 --> 01:46:24,716
 The whole game is we use the

1036
01:46:24,716 --> 01:46:27,333
 post-production magic, use the production

1037
01:46:27,333 --> 01:46:30,783
 data, stitch it together so the learner

1038
01:46:30,783 --> 01:46:31,899
 can understand this.

1039
01:46:32,300 --> 01:46:34,533
 I'm not saying the post-production team

1040
01:46:34,533 --> 01:46:36,533
 is not telling a story line.

1041
01:46:36,833 --> 01:46:39,083
 They are also telling another story line.

1042
01:46:39,083 --> 01:46:41,633
 Everybody is telling a story line, but I

1043
01:46:41,633 --> 01:46:42,816
 understand you are

1044
01:46:42,816 --> 01:46:44,083
 having a hard time doing this.

1045
01:46:44,100 --> 01:46:46,633
 I will give you a post-production plan.

1046
01:46:47,116 --> 01:46:50,116
 I will produce one and I will record my

1047
01:46:50,116 --> 01:46:52,383
 video production steps.

1048
01:46:52,716 --> 01:46:55,416
 Then I guess in the post-production plan,

1049
01:46:55,416 --> 01:46:57,383
 you will have everything.

1050
01:46:58,083 --> 01:47:00,833
 If you are saying, "Rofat, you gave me

1051
01:47:00,833 --> 01:47:02,066
 the post-production plan."

1052
01:47:02,433 --> 01:47:05,100
 You produced it, but it doesn't work out

1053
01:47:05,100 --> 01:47:07,033
 in a way that I expect.

1054
01:47:07,033 --> 01:47:08,083
 And it is still not

1055
01:47:08,083 --> 01:47:10,783
 understandable by the end users.

1056
01:47:11,433 --> 01:47:14,783
 I will fix it again and we will have a

1057
01:47:14,783 --> 01:47:17,300
 post-production plan ready for you.

1058
01:47:17,300 --> 01:47:20,149
 So it is easier for you to edit this.

1059
01:47:20,883 --> 01:47:23,183
 This is where I am at right now from this

1060
01:47:23,183 --> 01:47:25,100
 output for this video.

1061
01:47:25,416 --> 01:47:27,649
 And I wanted to have this call multiple

1062
01:47:27,649 --> 01:47:30,750
 times at MAMet because I understood that

1063
01:47:30,750 --> 01:47:32,899
 you guys might have a hard time.

1064
01:47:33,100 --> 01:47:35,683
 And I want to help you guys out to make

1065
01:47:35,683 --> 01:47:38,083
 sure we are going to do 10 videos like

1066
01:47:38,083 --> 01:47:40,866
 this on this advanced level course.

1067
01:47:41,399 --> 01:47:44,866
 And this course is going to be taken by

1068
01:47:44,866 --> 01:47:47,000
 the audience of OpenAI.

1069
01:47:47,933 --> 01:47:49,616
 Invidia the people who write the

1070
01:47:49,616 --> 01:47:53,266
 artificial intelligence chips and the

1071
01:47:53,266 --> 01:47:56,083
 large language models these Discourses

1072
01:47:56,083 --> 01:47:59,183
 for them this course is not for a Python

1073
01:47:59,183 --> 01:48:01,449
 developer that will come in and write

1074
01:48:01,449 --> 01:48:04,149
 Python We understand this course is how

1075
01:48:04,149 --> 01:48:06,616
 they are going to secure those models

1076
01:48:06,616 --> 01:48:10,333
 this the trillion for the trillion dollar

1077
01:48:10,333 --> 01:48:12,966
 companies this course is not for the

1078
01:48:13,350 --> 01:48:15,733
 General audience do you guys understand

1079
01:48:15,733 --> 01:48:18,433
 this is an advanced level course how they

1080
01:48:18,433 --> 01:48:19,750
 secure their models?

1081
01:48:22,433 --> 01:48:30,833
 Is that clear Yeah, exactly highly

1082
01:48:30,833 --> 01:48:32,966
 technical like one suggestion instead of

1083
01:48:32,966 --> 01:48:34,783
 doing these two three things you can just

1084
01:48:34,783 --> 01:48:36,816
 give us a rough structure It could be

1085
01:48:36,816 --> 01:48:40,550
 even 10 15 minutes long with the screen

1086
01:48:40,550 --> 01:48:42,000
 shares and your voiceover

1087
01:48:44,699 --> 01:48:46,933
 And We just we'll fine-tune it visually

1088
01:48:46,933 --> 01:48:49,166
 we'll add whichever element is required

1089
01:48:49,166 --> 01:48:51,350
 We'll make the those elements will create

1090
01:48:51,350 --> 01:48:54,233
 them in after effects or canva or in

1091
01:48:54,233 --> 01:48:56,550
 Premiere Pro wherever is needed my team

1092
01:48:56,550 --> 01:48:59,899
 will create a Visually like beautify it

1093
01:48:59,899 --> 01:49:02,316
 and then like the structure you can give

1094
01:49:02,316 --> 01:49:04,466
 us are you guys using the AI?

1095
01:49:05,500 --> 01:49:07,233
 Wasting your time and giving us three

1096
01:49:07,233 --> 01:49:11,083
 things What I will do is I will go use

1097
01:49:11,083 --> 01:49:14,149
 the AI to create a post-production plan

1098
01:49:14,350 --> 01:49:16,899
 Read it fix it and give it to you guys I

1099
01:49:16,899 --> 01:49:19,466
 will use artificial intelligence to be

1100
01:49:19,466 --> 01:49:21,366
 able to create the post-production plan

1101
01:49:21,366 --> 01:49:24,666
 and make it sense and Make sure all the

1102
01:49:24,666 --> 01:49:27,250
 artifacts that are mentioned there are

1103
01:49:27,250 --> 01:49:29,366
 inside these video slides

1104
01:49:29,366 --> 01:49:30,816
 and they are in the outputs

1105
01:49:31,983 --> 01:49:33,149
 That is what I will do

1106
01:49:34,683 --> 01:49:37,050
 So there is no gaps because the AI will

1107
01:49:37,050 --> 01:49:40,483
 create a post-production plan and can't

1108
01:49:40,483 --> 01:49:43,750
 yeah, absolutely my concern my Son then

1109
01:49:43,750 --> 01:49:45,183
 again will go back to what if that

1110
01:49:45,183 --> 01:49:47,366
 doesn't work as well and we again will

1111
01:49:47,366 --> 01:49:50,383
 come back to the same thing No, no if

1112
01:49:50,383 --> 01:49:52,533
 there is a plan and if I already

1113
01:49:52,933 --> 01:49:56,433
 the post-production team cannot run away

1114
01:49:56,433 --> 01:50:00,250
 because there is the produced video and

1115
01:50:00,250 --> 01:50:01,850
 there is the plan and there is the

1116
01:50:01,850 --> 01:50:04,899
 footages, input, system and an output.

1117
01:50:05,116 --> 01:50:05,633
 Where is the

1118
01:50:05,633 --> 01:50:07,783
 post-production team gonna run?

1119
01:50:07,783 --> 01:50:08,850
 There is no way to run.

1120
01:50:10,199 --> 01:50:12,850
 I use the input, I use the

1121
01:50:12,850 --> 01:50:14,649
 plan and I create an output.

1122
01:50:15,716 --> 01:50:17,233
 Ali, we want to start on this

1123
01:50:17,233 --> 01:50:18,550
 project as soon as possible.

1124
01:50:19,366 --> 01:50:19,983
 Yeah, very good.

1125
01:50:21,266 --> 01:50:24,316
 I will create your post-production plan

1126
01:50:24,316 --> 01:50:26,649
 as soon as possible with the output.

1127
01:50:28,383 --> 01:50:30,266
 That's alright, I will create it.

1128
01:50:30,266 --> 01:50:32,000
 So you will give us the rough structure?

1129
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:35,783
 No, no, I will give you the final output,

1130
01:50:36,350 --> 01:50:38,500
 I will give you the plan and the

1131
01:50:38,500 --> 01:50:41,716
 artifacts and show a video how they are

1132
01:50:41,716 --> 01:50:44,133
 mapping it and how I produce the output.

1133
01:50:45,816 --> 01:50:49,466
 So I will create a course to create a

1134
01:50:49,466 --> 01:50:52,183
 post-production video just for this

1135
01:50:52,183 --> 01:50:54,883
 course so they can follow up the video

1136
01:50:54,883 --> 01:50:57,550
 and while the artifacts are there, if I

1137
01:50:57,550 --> 01:51:00,666
 am able to do it post-production, you

1138
01:51:00,666 --> 01:51:02,949
 guys should be able to do it as well.

1139
01:51:04,983 --> 01:51:06,533
 By watching the video, we

1140
01:51:06,533 --> 01:51:08,183
 are creating video courses.

1141
01:51:08,649 --> 01:51:09,833
 I will create the video

1142
01:51:09,833 --> 01:51:11,850
 course to do post-production.

1143
01:51:15,300 --> 01:51:16,783
 And that will work out, right?

1144
01:51:17,550 --> 01:51:19,449
 I will give you the input, the artifacts.

1145
01:51:19,449 --> 01:51:23,783
 I am a little skeptical because if we get

1146
01:51:23,783 --> 01:51:25,666
 too many files again, then there will be

1147
01:51:25,666 --> 01:51:27,583
 too much confusion, might as well just

1148
01:51:27,583 --> 01:51:29,850
 get one file and we will fine tune it and

1149
01:51:29,850 --> 01:51:31,466
 we will do everything and beautify it and

1150
01:51:31,466 --> 01:51:33,233
 shorten it and make it as per the script.

1151
01:51:34,316 --> 01:51:36,783
 But we should have that file.

1152
01:51:36,816 --> 01:51:40,149
 I think Swati, Rifatib, what Swati is

1153
01:51:40,149 --> 01:51:41,116
 saying, we can do that, I

1154
01:51:41,116 --> 01:51:41,983
 think that will be the best.

1155
01:51:42,616 --> 01:51:44,766
 If we get one file with everything and

1156
01:51:44,766 --> 01:51:46,566
 then maybe it's 10 minutes long, 15

1157
01:51:46,566 --> 01:51:47,616
 minutes long, that's fine.

1158
01:51:48,183 --> 01:51:52,183
 We will trim it down as and when based on

1159
01:51:52,183 --> 01:51:54,033
 Swati and her team's understanding.

1160
01:51:54,616 --> 01:51:55,350
 That will be the

1161
01:51:55,350 --> 01:51:56,983
 easiest way of doing this.

1162
01:51:57,816 --> 01:51:58,683
 If they gave one file,

1163
01:51:58,899 --> 01:52:00,316
 they couldn't trim it out.

1164
01:52:00,316 --> 01:52:01,050
 That's the problem.

1165
01:52:02,250 --> 01:52:02,949
 No, no, no.

1166
01:52:02,949 --> 01:52:06,366
 Not in the form of Kamba or Kanva, but in

1167
01:52:06,366 --> 01:52:07,783
 the form of a file only.

1168
01:52:08,133 --> 01:52:09,866
 I also gave that as well.

1169
01:52:10,350 --> 01:52:11,783
 I also gave that as well.

1170
01:52:12,183 --> 01:52:14,449
 There's a storyboard one with the audio

1171
01:52:14,449 --> 01:52:16,933
 in it, with everything that is shown.

1172
01:52:17,233 --> 01:52:17,666
 That's the thing.

1173
01:52:18,283 --> 01:52:19,866
 It's too many files.

1174
01:52:22,050 --> 01:52:24,750
 Yes, I will give you one post-production

1175
01:52:24,750 --> 01:52:26,233
 output, the final

1176
01:52:26,233 --> 01:52:28,566
 video, with no editors used.

1177
01:52:28,566 --> 01:52:31,183
 That's all we need, that

1178
01:52:31,183 --> 01:52:32,566
 all we request from you.

1179
01:52:32,816 --> 01:52:34,566
 Yes, I will give the post-production

1180
01:52:34,566 --> 01:52:35,716
 output, the edited

1181
01:52:35,716 --> 01:52:39,466
 version, the plan and other stuff.

1182
01:52:39,466 --> 01:52:41,433
 You guys will understand this could be

1183
01:52:41,433 --> 01:52:43,850
 done by using these footages.

1184
01:52:44,383 --> 01:52:47,533
 He gave us the plan and all the steps and

1185
01:52:47,533 --> 01:52:49,783
 then go in the behind and think about it.

1186
01:52:49,833 --> 01:52:52,399
 This is where I am right now.

1187
01:52:52,399 --> 01:52:54,983
 Because if I can show that this is doable

1188
01:52:54,983 --> 01:52:57,750
 with the video production, then it will

1189
01:52:57,750 --> 01:53:00,933
 be able to say, "Okay, this is doable."

1190
01:53:00,933 --> 01:53:03,183
 But our main goal is to make sure that

1191
01:53:03,183 --> 01:53:06,333
 what Honoke is saying is also important.

1192
01:53:06,883 --> 01:53:11,183
 This is understandable by the learners.

1193
01:53:12,033 --> 01:53:14,116
 Once I finish one video, full

1194
01:53:14,116 --> 01:53:17,783
 post-production, we are going to say,

1195
01:53:17,816 --> 01:53:20,983
 "All right, this can be done.

1196
01:53:20,983 --> 01:53:21,250
 This is

1197
01:53:21,250 --> 01:53:23,500
 understandable and this is usable."

1198
01:53:23,883 --> 01:53:28,350
 I also understand Honoke's points there.

1199
01:53:28,350 --> 01:53:29,233
 There are some gaps.

1200
01:53:29,833 --> 01:53:31,183
 I will find those gaps.

1201
01:53:31,183 --> 01:53:33,216
 I will find those gaps and put them to

1202
01:53:33,216 --> 01:53:35,033
 the post-production plan.

1203
01:53:35,316 --> 01:53:38,399
 The post-production plan will include all

1204
01:53:38,399 --> 01:53:39,666
 those steps as well.

1205
01:53:40,333 --> 01:53:41,333
 There is no gap.

1206
01:53:41,866 --> 01:53:45,283
 If we are able to confirm the first

1207
01:53:45,283 --> 01:53:47,266
 video, if I can do the editing of the

1208
01:53:47,266 --> 01:53:50,783
 first video with all of it, then we will

1209
01:53:50,783 --> 01:53:52,166
 be able to go ahead and

1210
01:53:52,166 --> 01:53:53,433
 do the remaining ones.

1211
01:53:53,433 --> 01:53:55,350
 This is where I am right now.

1212
01:53:55,350 --> 01:53:58,733
 I need to do at least one video to make

1213
01:53:58,733 --> 01:54:01,833
 sure we are at the same place.

1214
01:54:02,050 --> 01:54:02,783
 Maybe the...

1215
01:54:02,816 --> 01:54:05,933
 number of the video files is overloading

1216
01:54:05,933 --> 01:54:07,666
 the team, the instructions,

1217
01:54:08,266 --> 01:54:10,383
 but let's see if I can do it.

1218
01:54:10,683 --> 01:54:13,283
 If I'm unable to do it, it is not

1219
01:54:13,283 --> 01:54:17,216
 acceptable for Hanukkah, for Hari, the

1220
01:54:17,216 --> 01:54:18,466
 post-production of

1221
01:54:18,466 --> 01:54:20,333
 Sivati to be able to do this.

1222
01:54:20,333 --> 01:54:23,033
 But if I can do this post-production, you

1223
01:54:23,033 --> 01:54:24,899
 guys should be able to do it as well.

1224
01:54:26,050 --> 01:54:27,816
 And if I record all the process,

1225
01:54:32,816 --> 01:54:33,000
 okay.

1226
01:54:33,483 --> 01:54:34,000
 Yes, yes.

1227
01:54:34,233 --> 01:54:36,449
 So while you're addressing these gaps, so

1228
01:54:36,449 --> 01:54:39,500
 I just wanted to make a point over here.

1229
01:54:39,766 --> 01:54:42,283
 So like, for example, when you say as I

1230
01:54:42,283 --> 01:54:45,449
 was giving this example, like ensure that

1231
01:54:45,449 --> 01:54:46,500
 the kernel is connected.

1232
01:54:46,850 --> 01:54:48,583
 Instead of saying that, ensure the kernel

1233
01:54:48,583 --> 01:54:50,149
 is connected because I've seen that

1234
01:54:50,149 --> 01:54:53,233
 you've been demonstrating that in that 16

1235
01:54:53,233 --> 01:54:54,816
 second video, right?

1236
01:54:55,216 --> 01:54:56,550
 So I would suggest you to provide a narration wherein the folks who are with

1237
01:54:56,550 --> 01:54:58,133
 you you to provide a narration wherein

1238
01:54:58,133 --> 01:55:01,449
 you explain the process of ensuring how

1239
01:55:01,449 --> 01:55:02,366
 the kernel is connected.

1240
01:55:03,083 --> 01:55:04,866
 Instead of just saying in the narration

1241
01:55:04,866 --> 01:55:07,383
 that ensure that it's connected, we are

1242
01:55:07,383 --> 01:55:10,500
 actually telling the learner the process

1243
01:55:10,500 --> 01:55:13,133
 of connecting the kernel.

1244
01:55:13,683 --> 01:55:15,449
 If you understand what

1245
01:55:15,449 --> 01:55:16,483
 I'm trying to say over here.

1246
01:55:16,933 --> 01:55:18,816
 So the process has to be explained.

1247
01:55:19,266 --> 01:55:20,750
 The process has to be explained instead

1248
01:55:20,750 --> 01:55:23,266
 of just saying that, make

1249
01:55:23,266 --> 01:55:24,250
 sure that this is connected.

1250
01:55:24,833 --> 01:55:27,283
 So it makes much more relatable for the

1251
01:55:27,283 --> 01:55:29,899
 learner and he would also be able to, he

1252
01:55:29,899 --> 01:55:31,216
 or she would be able to understand.

1253
01:55:31,750 --> 01:55:32,733
 Hanukkah, do you know

1254
01:55:32,733 --> 01:55:34,750
 how I am doing this course?

1255
01:55:34,983 --> 01:55:38,216
 I'm really turning on a system to be able

1256
01:55:38,216 --> 01:55:41,933
 to do an AI model security for open AI

1257
01:55:41,933 --> 01:55:43,500
 for the people who

1258
01:55:43,500 --> 01:55:45,116
 generate these AI systems.

1259
01:55:45,550 --> 01:55:48,383
 I am turning them on this system.

1260
01:55:48,716 --> 01:55:51,283
 There is a working system and there is a

1261
01:55:51,283 --> 01:55:53,616
 working code base for them.

1262
01:55:55,033 --> 01:55:56,783
 This is a code base

1263
01:55:56,783 --> 01:55:58,649
 that is working for them.

1264
01:55:58,899 --> 01:56:00,149
 I'm giving them the code.

1265
01:56:00,750 --> 01:56:01,983
 I'm giving them how

1266
01:56:01,983 --> 01:56:03,983
 it is running on here.

1267
01:56:04,583 --> 01:56:05,616
 I'm demonstrating

1268
01:56:05,616 --> 01:56:07,716
 something that is already.

1269
01:56:07,933 --> 01:56:11,266
 the adversarial evasion lab.

1270
01:56:11,933 --> 01:56:13,583
 So they are getting end to

1271
01:56:13,583 --> 01:56:15,933
 end from the start to the end.

1272
01:56:15,933 --> 01:56:18,149
 But for me to turn it on, I

1273
01:56:18,149 --> 01:56:19,766
 go through all these steps.

1274
01:56:20,383 --> 01:56:21,983
 I take the screenshots first.

1275
01:56:22,750 --> 01:56:24,183
 The screenshots are there.

1276
01:56:24,649 --> 01:56:25,883
 The system is working.

1277
01:56:26,116 --> 01:56:27,149
 Then what I do it is

1278
01:56:27,149 --> 01:56:28,850
 I put the voiceovers.

1279
01:56:29,550 --> 01:56:30,783
 I read the voiceovers.

1280
01:56:30,783 --> 01:56:33,399
 Then there's always the transition lines.

1281
01:56:33,649 --> 01:56:37,483
 And I make sure that I glued the image to

1282
01:56:37,483 --> 01:56:39,466
 the audio to make sure

1283
01:56:39,466 --> 01:56:41,066
 that while I'm reading it.

1284
01:56:41,383 --> 01:56:42,866
 But right now, your problem

1285
01:56:42,866 --> 01:56:45,433
 is you are unable to see it.

1286
01:56:45,899 --> 01:56:47,783
 So what I will do it is I will add a

1287
01:56:47,783 --> 01:56:49,583
 post-production plan so

1288
01:56:49,583 --> 01:56:51,149
 you will be able to get it.

1289
01:56:51,149 --> 01:56:53,033
 There is one more person in the call.

1290
01:56:54,350 --> 01:56:55,766
 I hope we are not going to

1291
01:56:55,766 --> 01:56:57,266
 explain it one more time.

1292
01:56:57,666 --> 01:56:59,616
 But I will try to do my best.

1293
01:57:01,133 --> 01:57:01,866
 Hello, Luma.

1294
01:57:01,899 --> 01:57:02,616
 How are you?

1295
01:57:04,250 --> 01:57:05,783
 What we are trying to do is-- Oh, hi.

1296
01:57:06,383 --> 01:57:06,933
 I found you.

1297
01:57:07,133 --> 01:57:08,983
 I shared the-- It's twice the head of

1298
01:57:08,983 --> 01:57:11,050
 the-- I shared the post-production plan

1299
01:57:12,050 --> 01:57:15,183
 for this screen capture piece for the

1300
01:57:15,183 --> 01:57:17,000
 module one and video one.

1301
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:19,666
 And I'm trying to create a template to

1302
01:57:19,666 --> 01:57:22,500
 make sure that we can all follow this to

1303
01:57:22,500 --> 01:57:26,216
 be able to produce a course for open AI's

1304
01:57:26,216 --> 01:57:29,183
 team for them to be able to do a complex

1305
01:57:29,183 --> 01:57:32,266
 course on AI though.

1306
01:57:32,483 --> 01:57:34,683
 And they have all the necessary code

1307
01:57:34,683 --> 01:57:36,033
 pieces to be able to

1308
01:57:36,033 --> 01:57:38,166
 run this evasion attack.

1309
01:57:38,633 --> 01:57:40,433
 So that's what we are doing.

1310
01:57:40,850 --> 01:57:43,750
 And for this, for each scene, what I

1311
01:57:43,750 --> 01:57:48,566
 provided is a screenshot, a title, a

1312
01:57:48,566 --> 01:57:52,683
 voiceover, a scene number, and the AI

1313
01:57:52,683 --> 01:57:54,833
 Gemini notes with the code pieces.

1314
01:57:55,266 --> 01:57:57,383
 So the post-production can do it.

1315
01:57:57,399 --> 01:58:01,366
 But still, as far as I understood, you

1316
01:58:01,366 --> 01:58:04,266
 guys are not using the AI that much to be

1317
01:58:04,266 --> 01:58:06,433
 able to create a post-production plan.

1318
01:58:06,816 --> 01:58:09,866
 I will create a post-production plan and

1319
01:58:09,866 --> 01:58:12,783
 with artificial intelligence, not myself.

1320
01:58:13,316 --> 01:58:16,233
 and record it during the process how I

1321
01:58:16,233 --> 01:58:18,883
 create the post-production plan then use

1322
01:58:18,883 --> 01:58:22,283
 my existing footage as an input and Use

1323
01:58:22,283 --> 01:58:25,883
 the AI's plan and then create an output a

1324
01:58:25,883 --> 01:58:28,566
 post-production end-to-end and show the

1325
01:58:28,933 --> 01:58:31,933
 post-production team of star weaver So

1326
01:58:31,933 --> 01:58:34,883
 how you guys can edit one video and I

1327
01:58:34,883 --> 01:58:37,316
 will fix the problems and I will see

1328
01:58:37,483 --> 01:58:40,216
 Where my gaps are on the post-production

1329
01:58:40,216 --> 01:58:43,133
 plan So you guys will be able to give me

1330
01:58:43,133 --> 01:58:45,983
 a go ahead for one screen capture Then I

1331
01:58:45,983 --> 01:58:47,683
 will go ahead and finish the remaining

1332
01:58:47,683 --> 01:58:50,350
 ten screen captures in this style.

1333
01:58:50,350 --> 01:58:52,816
 So that is where we are it

1334
01:58:54,399 --> 01:58:56,399
 So you're trying to say that you're going

1335
01:58:56,399 --> 01:59:00,233
 to record My I mean all the elements

1336
01:59:00,233 --> 01:59:02,066
 separately and then you're going to both

1337
01:59:02,066 --> 01:59:06,116
 produce that yeah And give you guys a

1338
01:59:06,116 --> 01:59:09,083
 plan so you guys can follow up that plan

1339
01:59:09,083 --> 01:59:12,550
 This is an advanced level course for open

1340
01:59:12,550 --> 01:59:15,583
 AI steam the people who are using

1341
01:59:15,583 --> 01:59:19,500
 creating the artificial intelligence This

1342
01:59:19,500 --> 01:59:23,116
 course if just shut it will take one hour

1343
01:59:23,116 --> 01:59:25,666
 to two hours just for one module There is

1344
01:59:25,666 --> 01:59:27,033
 ten different tools

1345
01:59:27,033 --> 01:59:29,033
 that comes in in here.

1346
01:59:29,033 --> 01:59:32,883
 So I shut it in a style of 16 seconds

1347
01:59:32,883 --> 01:59:35,983
 screen captures, but it is Overloading

1348
01:59:35,983 --> 01:59:39,133
 the video production team because video

1349
01:59:39,133 --> 01:59:41,716
 production team is having a hard time

1350
01:59:41,716 --> 01:59:44,449
 then to show the audio Then to show the

1351
01:59:44,449 --> 01:59:46,750
 video then to show an animation meant to

1352
01:59:46,750 --> 01:59:49,966
 show the presentation For me it is clear

1353
01:59:49,966 --> 01:59:51,683
 but for them it is not clear.

1354
01:59:51,683 --> 01:59:53,283
 I say top right.

1355
01:59:53,283 --> 01:59:54,250
 It's on the top left.

1356
01:59:54,250 --> 01:59:57,550
 They are unable to Remove the right

1357
01:59:57,550 --> 01:59:59,483
 keyword from the audio.

1358
02:00:00,183 --> 02:00:03,283
 They need to say it's on the top I know

1359
02:00:03,283 --> 02:00:05,433
 it, but they don't know it and I can also

1360
02:00:05,433 --> 02:00:07,383
 relate to them as well though.

1361
02:00:07,383 --> 02:00:10,166
 It is not that easy So I will give them

1362
02:00:10,166 --> 02:00:12,649
 the post-production plan But what I will

1363
02:00:12,649 --> 02:00:15,433
 do is I will go to the AI create a

1364
02:00:15,433 --> 02:00:17,550
 post-production plan for each scene

1365
02:00:18,050 --> 02:00:19,250
 Put it there for you.

1366
02:00:19,566 --> 02:00:21,216
 I will edit it for you.

1367
02:00:21,216 --> 02:00:23,449
 So you guys will see the input, the

1368
02:00:23,449 --> 02:00:24,883
 footage that I create, the

1369
02:00:24,883 --> 02:00:26,050
 post-production plan

1370
02:00:26,050 --> 02:00:27,816
 that the AI has created.

1371
02:00:27,816 --> 02:00:30,083
 And I will record how I am doing it so

1372
02:00:30,083 --> 02:00:32,149
 you guys can do it for the other videos.

1373
02:00:32,533 --> 02:00:34,816
 And I will show you guys the output so

1374
02:00:34,816 --> 02:00:36,783
 the learner can learn it.

1375
02:00:36,783 --> 02:00:39,383
 The learner meaning the open AI audience

1376
02:00:39,383 --> 02:00:42,350
 can learn how to secure their own models.

1377
02:00:42,816 --> 02:00:44,716
 These are highly technical people.

1378
02:00:45,250 --> 02:00:47,816
 They also don't want a one-hour course.

1379
02:00:48,683 --> 02:00:49,883
 They want three minute

1380
02:00:49,883 --> 02:00:51,766
 video for one screen capture.

1381
02:00:52,366 --> 02:00:53,383
 They will be able to

1382
02:00:53,383 --> 02:00:55,033
 trigger most of these stuff.

1383
02:00:56,399 --> 02:00:59,899
 Because the Starweaver is focused on

1384
02:00:59,899 --> 02:01:03,233
 doing the video production, not on the AI

1385
02:01:03,233 --> 02:01:05,966
 pieces, but that open AI people are

1386
02:01:05,966 --> 02:01:07,466
 focused on the AI pieces.

1387
02:01:07,816 --> 02:01:09,250
 When I say code spaces,

1388
02:01:09,483 --> 02:01:10,833
 they understand code spaces.

1389
02:01:11,283 --> 02:01:12,250
 When I say Gemini,

1390
02:01:12,483 --> 02:01:13,633
 they understand Gemini.

1391
02:01:14,266 --> 02:01:16,683
 And to speed this process up, I use the

1392
02:01:16,683 --> 02:01:19,500
 AI and show the learners how I am turning

1393
02:01:19,500 --> 02:01:21,399
 on these systems using

1394
02:01:21,399 --> 02:01:22,816
 artificial intelligence.

1395
02:01:23,483 --> 02:01:25,366
 So there is lots of AI support.

1396
02:01:26,250 --> 02:01:28,833
 This is an AI course.

1397
02:01:29,050 --> 02:01:31,566
 We are going to use the AI to be able to

1398
02:01:31,566 --> 02:01:33,233
 plan it, to be able to produce

1399
02:01:33,233 --> 02:01:35,283
 it, and to be able to post it.

1400
02:01:35,333 --> 02:01:39,833
 I know it is a transformational time for

1401
02:01:39,833 --> 02:01:42,233
 video production to use artificial

1402
02:01:42,233 --> 02:01:45,583
 intelligence as a heads-up display.

1403
02:01:46,033 --> 02:01:47,899
 But I will do it to you guys so you guys

1404
02:01:47,899 --> 02:01:50,233
 will be able to learn how to do this.

1405
02:01:50,233 --> 02:01:53,250
 And I will see where my gaps are in terms

1406
02:01:53,250 --> 02:01:55,649
 of the post-production plan.

1407
02:01:56,133 --> 02:01:58,866
 And Mamed and Svetyal already said this

1408
02:01:58,866 --> 02:02:01,366
 will add one more layer on top.

1409
02:02:01,866 --> 02:02:06,283
 But with this rise of the AI, let me tell

1410
02:02:06,283 --> 02:02:08,183
 you guys something very important.

1411
02:02:08,883 --> 02:02:10,583
 The old jobs are...

1412
02:02:11,533 --> 02:02:11,949
 Bye-bye.

1413
02:02:12,533 --> 02:02:14,616
 This is the reality.

1414
02:02:15,233 --> 02:02:16,750
 There is going to be new jobs.

1415
02:02:17,166 --> 02:02:20,233
 If we go back to 100 years ago, there is

1416
02:02:20,233 --> 02:02:22,399
 lots of people that are doing the horses.

1417
02:02:23,116 --> 02:02:25,066
 Lots of people that are cleaning the

1418
02:02:25,066 --> 02:02:27,083
 horse shit all over the streets.

1419
02:02:27,083 --> 02:02:29,866
 There are lots of dead horses There was a

1420
02:02:29,866 --> 02:02:34,350
 big economy that economy is gone There is

1421
02:02:34,350 --> 02:02:36,366
 no more video editors in the future.

1422
02:02:36,366 --> 02:02:38,866
 There is no more coders in the future

1423
02:02:38,866 --> 02:02:41,616
 There is all these new roles that are

1424
02:02:41,616 --> 02:02:45,816
 coming up So we are using the AI and you

1425
02:02:45,816 --> 02:02:48,533
 guys are not anymore video editors You

1426
02:02:48,533 --> 02:02:52,399
 guys are AI enabled Something else not a

1427
02:02:52,399 --> 02:02:55,716
 video editor not even a video editor Not

1428
02:02:55,716 --> 02:02:58,833
 even the roles that you guys think so we

1429
02:02:58,833 --> 02:03:01,883
 are entering into that kind of a future I

1430
02:03:01,883 --> 02:03:04,216
 understand we are at that timeline and it

1431
02:03:04,216 --> 02:03:07,566
 is creating an issue for you guys But

1432
02:03:07,566 --> 02:03:09,616
 that is the reality and these guys who

1433
02:03:09,616 --> 02:03:12,183
 are going to take this course are Driving

1434
02:03:12,183 --> 02:03:15,316
 this the open AI people who are going to

1435
02:03:15,316 --> 02:03:17,816
 take this course are driving this So it

1436
02:03:17,816 --> 02:03:19,766
 is okay for them to get a compressed

1437
02:03:19,766 --> 02:03:22,149
 course There I put all these ten

1438
02:03:22,149 --> 02:03:23,933
 different tools that they are going to

1439
02:03:23,933 --> 02:03:27,233
 use and it is creating an overload in you

1440
02:03:27,233 --> 02:03:29,033
 guys I also understand I

1441
02:03:29,033 --> 02:03:31,316
 call it Can you do one thing?

1442
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:33,133
 Sorry to interrupt you.

1443
02:03:33,133 --> 02:03:34,550
 So if it can we do one thing?

1444
02:03:34,550 --> 02:03:38,133
 Can you simplify this process to because

1445
02:03:38,133 --> 02:03:41,149
 the I'll tell you You you have worked

1446
02:03:41,149 --> 02:03:42,766
 with us and how star

1447
02:03:42,766 --> 02:03:43,833
 we were generally works.

1448
02:03:43,833 --> 02:03:46,350
 It's very simple We just asked the SMEs

1449
02:03:46,350 --> 02:03:49,766
 to create some, you know demo demos using

1450
02:03:50,333 --> 02:03:55,366
 screen shares so With audio so only that

1451
02:03:55,366 --> 02:03:57,350
 pattern there is another type which is

1452
02:03:57,350 --> 02:03:59,583
 which you have already done Which is just

1453
02:03:59,583 --> 02:04:01,350
 a talking head where you are talking in

1454
02:04:01,350 --> 02:04:05,949
 front of the camera so By any chance we

1455
02:04:05,949 --> 02:04:08,833
 can can we simplify this so that you know

1456
02:04:08,833 --> 02:04:11,500
 We follow the process that we

1457
02:04:11,500 --> 02:04:13,399
 are falling from so many years

1458
02:04:15,183 --> 02:04:17,050
 only Only your course.

1459
02:04:17,050 --> 02:04:18,633
 I will tell you to be honest only your

1460
02:04:18,633 --> 02:04:21,066
 course where we have to work in a

1461
02:04:21,066 --> 02:04:24,183
 different manner Yes, because I we want

1462
02:04:24,183 --> 02:04:26,983
 you to feel comfortable Mm-hmm

1463
02:04:28,050 --> 02:04:29,783
 Get ready, get ready,

1464
02:04:30,183 --> 02:04:31,683
 these horses are gonna go.

1465
02:04:32,166 --> 02:04:35,716
 What you are telling me, I am using AI to

1466
02:04:35,716 --> 02:04:37,399
 create this, and you are

1467
02:04:37,399 --> 02:04:39,233
 telling me, why do we have roads?

1468
02:04:39,500 --> 02:04:40,466
 Why do we have cars?

1469
02:04:40,933 --> 02:04:42,399
 We have nice horses here.

1470
02:04:42,850 --> 02:04:44,433
 Why don't we use the horses?

1471
02:04:45,883 --> 02:04:49,116
 I feel you should work internally as our

1472
02:04:49,116 --> 02:04:50,783
 internal star viewer team.

1473
02:04:50,833 --> 02:04:55,966
 But you guys are trying to

1474
02:04:55,966 --> 02:04:57,983
 use AI as well in the website.

1475
02:04:58,883 --> 02:05:01,000
 There is lots of stuff written about AI.

1476
02:05:01,500 --> 02:05:02,583
 Come on, use the AI.

1477
02:05:03,266 --> 02:05:05,983
 In production also we use a lot of

1478
02:05:05,983 --> 02:05:07,066
 artificial intelligence,

1479
02:05:07,333 --> 02:05:08,966
 scripting and everything.

1480
02:05:09,233 --> 02:05:10,783
 A lot of it we use it.

1481
02:05:11,133 --> 02:05:14,633
 So I will show you guys how to use AI.

1482
02:05:14,633 --> 02:05:17,050
 The content, SME is very relevant for us

1483
02:05:17,050 --> 02:05:20,750
 and what it comes from, horses, that is a

1484
02:05:20,750 --> 02:05:21,949
 very critical part and we

1485
02:05:21,949 --> 02:05:23,316
 cannot play around with that.

1486
02:05:23,483 --> 02:05:24,949
 The content we receive from you.

1487
02:05:25,466 --> 02:05:29,583
 Yes, I will show how I use the AI, how to

1488
02:05:29,583 --> 02:05:32,766
 create the post-production plan using the

1489
02:05:32,766 --> 02:05:35,333
 existing stuff that I

1490
02:05:35,333 --> 02:05:36,783
 have provided to you guys.

1491
02:05:36,833 --> 02:05:39,166
 So you guys will be able to see and

1492
02:05:39,166 --> 02:05:41,066
 create the video, not just talk.

1493
02:05:41,449 --> 02:05:42,283
 Create the video.

1494
02:05:42,283 --> 02:05:43,266
 I will show you guys.

1495
02:05:43,666 --> 02:05:45,183
 This car can go from

1496
02:05:45,183 --> 02:05:47,233
 New York to San Francisco.

1497
02:05:47,883 --> 02:05:50,766
 And we don't need a horse to go from New

1498
02:05:50,766 --> 02:05:51,883
 York to San Francisco.

1499
02:05:52,399 --> 02:05:54,000
 This car goes very fast.

1500
02:05:54,550 --> 02:05:56,133
 The AI will be able to

1501
02:05:56,133 --> 02:05:57,649
 do the post-production.

1502
02:05:58,033 --> 02:06:00,283
 But right now if you think that you need

1503
02:06:00,283 --> 02:06:02,566
 a horse, you are trying to put the horse

1504
02:06:02,566 --> 02:06:05,149
 inside the car and try to go from New

1505
02:06:05,149 --> 02:06:05,783
 York to San Francisco.

1506
02:06:05,816 --> 02:06:08,000
 I am not trying to do that.

1507
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:10,583
 I am trying to use the AI to build the

1508
02:06:10,583 --> 02:06:11,716
 course and to make

1509
02:06:11,716 --> 02:06:13,633
 sure we go from A to B.

1510
02:06:13,633 --> 02:06:14,750
 I know it is not easy.

1511
02:06:14,966 --> 02:06:16,149
 I know it is a big change.

1512
02:06:16,566 --> 02:06:18,949
 It is a big transitional time all over

1513
02:06:18,949 --> 02:06:20,366
 the world for everyone.

1514
02:06:20,649 --> 02:06:23,850
 Do not forget these courses for OpenAI.

1515
02:06:24,366 --> 02:06:25,683
 That is for the audience.

1516
02:06:25,949 --> 02:06:27,133
 The title of the courses.

1517
02:06:27,633 --> 02:06:29,683
 How do you secure your AI models?

1518
02:06:30,350 --> 02:06:31,466
 These courses for them.

1519
02:06:32,833 --> 02:06:33,866
 Yeah, so I will tell

1520
02:06:33,866 --> 02:06:35,233
 you something, Rifat.

1521
02:06:35,233 --> 02:06:38,866
 So what we can do is, you create your

1522
02:06:38,866 --> 02:06:40,399
 first piece of screen shares.

1523
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:42,250
 According to your style,

1524
02:06:42,500 --> 02:06:44,050
 let's share it with us.

1525
02:06:44,316 --> 02:06:46,550
 Let's you, me and Manu connect once again

1526
02:06:46,550 --> 02:06:50,449
 and see how things can be, you know, much

1527
02:06:50,449 --> 02:06:52,333
 smoother following our process.

1528
02:06:52,949 --> 02:06:54,133
 Uma, hold on.

1529
02:06:54,383 --> 02:06:55,983
 I created 10 screen shares.

1530
02:06:56,583 --> 02:06:58,333
 The screen shares are already created.

1531
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:02,766
 What the team cannot follow it is when

1532
02:07:02,766 --> 02:07:04,683
 they are going to put the screen shares.

1533
02:07:04,933 --> 02:07:05,866
 That is their problem.

1534
02:07:06,533 --> 02:07:08,383
 The screen shares are already there.

1535
02:07:09,583 --> 02:07:12,750
 The screen shares are already created.

1536
02:07:12,750 --> 02:07:13,766
 Manu, can you share

1537
02:07:13,766 --> 02:07:15,816
 some of his screen shares?

1538
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:16,866
 Look, the screen

1539
02:07:16,866 --> 02:07:18,433
 shares are already created.

1540
02:07:18,683 --> 02:07:21,000
 I think once you start sharing your

1541
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:22,066
 screen, I think you go there.

1542
02:07:22,283 --> 02:07:24,333
 The screen shares are already created.

1543
02:07:25,050 --> 02:07:26,783
 The images are already there.

1544
02:07:26,816 --> 02:07:29,000
 The voiceover is there.

1545
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:30,399
 The screen ID is there.

1546
02:07:30,399 --> 02:07:31,399
 They are already there.

1547
02:07:32,933 --> 02:07:37,233
 What is not there is the plan to be able

1548
02:07:37,233 --> 02:07:40,500
 to place them step by step is not there.

1549
02:07:41,466 --> 02:07:42,066
 Thus, I already

1550
02:07:42,066 --> 02:07:43,466
 created the screen shares.

1551
02:07:44,149 --> 02:07:45,716
 They are already there and

1552
02:07:45,716 --> 02:07:47,216
 I already read through them.

1553
02:07:47,566 --> 02:07:48,283
 They see this.

1554
02:07:48,583 --> 02:07:51,366
 I tell them, be mindful of

1555
02:07:51,366 --> 02:07:53,216
 the compute costs, it says.

1556
02:07:53,966 --> 02:07:56,750
 While we use free tiers today, training a

1557
02:07:56,750 --> 02:07:59,383
 large scale adversarial attacks in real

1558
02:07:59,399 --> 02:08:01,133
 worlds gets expensive fast.

1559
02:08:01,500 --> 02:08:02,683
 There is an image there

1560
02:08:02,683 --> 02:08:04,066
 and it shows the pricing.

1561
02:08:04,733 --> 02:08:06,899
 And another option is and there is also

1562
02:08:06,899 --> 02:08:08,250
 the transitional light.

1563
02:08:08,850 --> 02:08:10,466
 So I gave you guys the images.

1564
02:08:10,816 --> 02:08:12,266
 I gave you guys the audio.

1565
02:08:19,616 --> 02:08:22,816
 Yes, I gave you guys.

1566
02:08:23,449 --> 02:08:24,500
 I'm a bit too loud.

1567
02:08:24,500 --> 02:08:25,116
 I'm in a hotel.

1568
02:08:25,333 --> 02:08:26,816
 I hope I didn't wake up everyone.

1569
02:08:28,183 --> 02:08:29,433
 I gave you guys the images.

1570
02:08:29,750 --> 02:08:31,149
 I gave you guys the audio.

1571
02:08:38,316 --> 02:08:39,816
 So, sorry, image and

1572
02:08:39,816 --> 02:08:41,483
 where to show the video part.

1573
02:08:41,833 --> 02:08:44,149
 So that we are facing and in some slides

1574
02:08:44,149 --> 02:08:46,216
 we are having three images.

1575
02:08:47,566 --> 02:08:49,449
 So in the three images we have to show it

1576
02:08:49,449 --> 02:08:51,399
 separately or we have to show it together

1577
02:08:52,399 --> 02:08:53,783
 like that we are having that.

1578
02:08:53,783 --> 02:08:56,683
 So Hari, do you have this in the slide

1579
02:08:56,683 --> 02:08:59,399
 format or what is the output?

1580
02:09:00,033 --> 02:09:03,883
 So in Canva there is one Canva entire

1581
02:09:03,883 --> 02:09:07,550
 podcast presentation that has embedded

1582
02:09:07,550 --> 02:09:11,716
 videos seen by scene, every scene is

1583
02:09:11,716 --> 02:09:14,399
 defined, every scene there are images

1584
02:09:14,399 --> 02:09:15,066
 like so there are

1585
02:09:15,066 --> 02:09:16,183
 three images in one video.

1586
02:09:16,783 --> 02:09:19,316
 Now while we have the content for the

1587
02:09:19,316 --> 02:09:22,000
 editors what is the problem here like

1588
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:23,850
 Difert also said that because he is the

1589
02:09:23,850 --> 02:09:26,316
 expert we as laymen cannot understand

1590
02:09:26,316 --> 02:09:27,783
 what comes into well.

1591
02:09:28,416 --> 02:09:30,383
 While we have the content we do not know

1592
02:09:30,383 --> 02:09:32,216
 how to align it with your view.

1593
02:09:32,399 --> 02:09:34,033
 So do we have that audio

1594
02:09:34,033 --> 02:09:36,350
 script in the notes or where?

1595
02:09:37,266 --> 02:09:37,833
 Inside the video.

1596
02:09:38,266 --> 02:09:41,033
 As well from Difert in the notes also but

1597
02:09:41,033 --> 02:09:44,866
 the note is suppose a three line and when

1598
02:09:44,866 --> 02:09:47,633
 a three line has to have the where does

1599
02:09:47,633 --> 02:09:49,683
 it have to have the image then where does

1600
02:09:49,683 --> 02:09:52,033
 that screen shape play comes in we need

1601
02:09:52,033 --> 02:09:53,633
 to get that in scene.

1602
02:09:54,216 --> 02:09:57,066
 Yes so basically I will tell you this if

1603
02:09:57,066 --> 02:09:59,050
 Difert if you want to follow this

1604
02:09:59,050 --> 02:10:04,166
 approach we call it Stole.

1605
02:10:06,166 --> 02:10:10,616
 Types of the other one happen.

1606
02:10:12,616 --> 02:10:14,266
 These slides you have rightly placed

1607
02:10:14,266 --> 02:10:24,399
 those errors seen on this particular word

1608
02:10:24,399 --> 02:10:26,866
 this image should have got whatever there

1609
02:10:26,866 --> 02:10:29,899
 is a detail story word has to happen if

1610
02:10:29,899 --> 02:10:30,883
 we have to follow this

1611
02:10:30,883 --> 02:10:32,449
 approach having too many elements.

1612
02:10:34,066 --> 02:10:36,750
 And also Uma we have reviewed couple of

1613
02:10:36,750 --> 02:10:37,666
 slides I reviewed it

1614
02:10:37,666 --> 02:10:39,750
 with Difert right here.

1615
02:10:40,333 --> 02:10:42,733
 So the thing is like.

1616
02:10:42,816 --> 02:10:44,766
 If we have multiple videos right these

1617
02:10:44,766 --> 02:10:49,533
 are code snippets and the intensive right

1618
02:10:49,533 --> 02:10:51,500
 so there are a lot of codes involved if

1619
02:10:51,500 --> 02:10:53,933
 we just have so if that particular image

1620
02:10:53,933 --> 02:11:02,483
 is shown then then can we turn off the

1621
02:11:02,483 --> 02:11:04,000
 cameras maintenance

1622
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:05,383
 connections going down.

1623
02:11:09,933 --> 02:11:13,566
 I think I've discussed this thing with

1624
02:11:13,566 --> 02:11:15,633
 Rifat as well so the cognitive load is

1625
02:11:15,633 --> 02:11:16,933
 something which we'd have to see like for

1626
02:11:16,933 --> 02:11:20,350
 example there is a 16 second demo and we

1627
02:11:20,350 --> 02:11:23,316
 are trying to show that corresponding to

1628
02:11:23,316 --> 02:11:26,750
 a three or four word narration.

1629
02:11:28,949 --> 02:11:32,033
 This is something which we'll have to

1630
02:11:32,033 --> 02:11:34,933
 have a look into because there needs to

1631
02:11:34,933 --> 02:11:36,899
 be enough settlement time for the learner

1632
02:11:36,899 --> 02:11:39,850
 to kind of understand what is coming on

1633
02:11:39,850 --> 02:11:41,566
 the screen and there needs to be proper

1634
02:11:41,566 --> 02:11:49,449
 annotations to that point which the SME

1635
02:11:49,449 --> 02:11:51,666
 or Rifat is actually referring to right

1636
02:11:51,666 --> 02:11:54,149
 so this is the actual code which Rifat

1637
02:11:54,149 --> 02:11:55,833
 was talking about so that needs to be

1638
02:11:55,833 --> 02:11:58,266
 kind of annotated or highlighted so those

1639
02:11:58,266 --> 02:11:59,816
 things would need to happen when we

1640
02:11:59,816 --> 02:12:01,983
 provide a very big image or a code

1641
02:12:01,983 --> 02:12:04,666
 snippet right so such things need to be

1642
02:12:04,666 --> 02:12:07,216
 there otherwise it would add a lot of

1643
02:12:07,216 --> 02:12:08,899
 cognitive load for the learner to kind of

1644
02:12:08,899 --> 02:12:10,933
 even understand he or she would not even

1645
02:12:10,933 --> 02:12:12,866
 able to understand what has been even

1646
02:12:12,866 --> 02:12:15,399
 covered right so because things would

1647
02:12:15,399 --> 02:12:16,616
 come and go on the screen.

1648
02:12:17,149 --> 02:12:22,083
 Hanukkah this is not a course for

1649
02:12:22,083 --> 02:12:25,616
 beginners this is for the course who is

1650
02:12:25,616 --> 02:12:28,366
 creating the artificial intelligence they

1651
02:12:28,366 --> 02:12:31,183
 will be able to get this much load

1652
02:12:31,183 --> 02:12:34,649
 because as we said if I make this in one

1653
02:12:34,649 --> 02:12:37,500
 shot this is a one hour two hour video

1654
02:12:37,500 --> 02:12:41,316
 for just three minutes those people do

1655
02:12:41,316 --> 02:12:43,666
 not have first of all that much of a time

1656
02:12:43,666 --> 02:12:45,666
 and they already know when

1657
02:12:45,666 --> 02:12:47,783
 I show them the Gemini you.

1658
02:12:47,983 --> 02:12:52,550
 or code spaces or Jupyter Labs,

1659
02:12:53,566 --> 02:12:55,966
 they already know what is there.

1660
02:12:56,683 --> 02:12:59,833
 So this is an advanced level course, 16

1661
02:12:59,833 --> 02:13:03,850
 seconds per a screen capture and a three

1662
02:13:03,850 --> 02:13:06,949
 second for an image is enough for them.

1663
02:13:06,949 --> 02:13:08,250
 I'm just gluing all the

1664
02:13:08,250 --> 02:13:10,350
 parts so they can make this work.

1665
02:13:12,233 --> 02:13:12,983
 Yeah, so there needs

1666
02:13:12,983 --> 02:13:14,066
 to be proper annotation.

1667
02:13:14,083 --> 02:13:17,716
 Even though it can be for an advanced

1668
02:13:17,716 --> 02:13:19,316
 level learner, that's fine, I understand.

1669
02:13:19,733 --> 02:13:22,783
 They might not need things to be

1670
02:13:22,783 --> 02:13:24,766
 explained in much more detail, but the

1671
02:13:24,766 --> 02:13:26,783
 thing is that there needs to be enough

1672
02:13:26,783 --> 02:13:30,083
 settlement time for anyone who views the

1673
02:13:30,083 --> 02:13:31,566
 video to kind of

1674
02:13:31,566 --> 02:13:33,350
 actually read the things.

1675
02:13:33,350 --> 02:13:35,483
 Not anyone, not anyone.

1676
02:13:35,833 --> 02:13:38,033
 This is just for the open AI team.

1677
02:13:38,033 --> 02:13:39,933
 This is not for everyone.

1678
02:13:40,250 --> 02:13:42,183
 Everyone, I completely agree.

1679
02:13:42,216 --> 02:13:44,949
 Everyone will not be able to get this,

1680
02:13:44,949 --> 02:13:47,116
 such as you go and

1681
02:13:47,116 --> 02:13:48,850
 watch a boxing training,

1682
02:13:51,166 --> 02:13:53,116
 heavyweight boxer training, you won't be

1683
02:13:53,116 --> 02:13:55,783
 able to go to street and the heavyweight

1684
02:13:55,783 --> 02:13:57,166
 boxing, somebody will

1685
02:13:57,166 --> 02:13:58,250
 beat you up, a boxer.

1686
02:13:58,816 --> 02:14:01,216
 This is just for the heavyweight boxer.

1687
02:14:01,583 --> 02:14:03,083
 Not for you, not for everyone.

1688
02:14:05,316 --> 02:14:06,449
 This is not for everyone.

1689
02:14:08,133 --> 02:14:09,433
 But still we need to

1690
02:14:09,433 --> 02:14:10,566
 provide proper annotation.

1691
02:14:10,899 --> 02:14:13,483
 See, the thing is when client reviews it,

1692
02:14:13,783 --> 02:14:18,866
 they are not an expert like you are in

1693
02:14:18,866 --> 02:14:19,666
 this particular subject.

1694
02:14:19,983 --> 02:14:21,833
 So when they also would review, they

1695
02:14:21,833 --> 02:14:24,149
 would understand from this perspective,

1696
02:14:24,149 --> 02:14:25,816
 settlement time, cognitive

1697
02:14:25,816 --> 02:14:27,050
 load and all those things.

1698
02:14:27,050 --> 02:14:28,716
 So these are things which as

1699
02:14:28,716 --> 02:14:30,566
 instructional designers, we

1700
02:14:30,566 --> 02:14:32,399
 take things into consideration.

1701
02:14:33,566 --> 02:14:38,383
 Yes, the cognitive load can be taken, by

1702
02:14:38,383 --> 02:14:41,333
 creating animations at

1703
02:14:41,333 --> 02:14:42,683
 the correct timeline.

1704
02:14:42,683 --> 02:14:45,566
 The more animations that you do, the less

1705
02:14:45,566 --> 02:14:49,333
 cognitive load the audience will have.

1706
02:14:49,716 --> 02:14:51,683
 So you need to create such

1707
02:14:51,683 --> 02:14:52,783
 as one side, (Audio Cuts Out)

1708
02:14:52,833 --> 02:14:56,233
 Told you once they say running state of

1709
02:14:56,233 --> 02:14:58,333
 the kernel, you need to

1710
02:14:58,333 --> 02:14:59,750
 show the kernel animation.

1711
02:15:00,333 --> 02:15:02,966
 So you take the cognitive load from the

1712
02:15:02,966 --> 02:15:05,149
 text and put it to the animation.

1713
02:15:05,616 --> 02:15:06,816
 Yes, you can do that.

1714
02:15:07,216 --> 02:15:09,333
 Take the cognitive load from them by

1715
02:15:09,333 --> 02:15:10,733
 creating animations at

1716
02:15:10,733 --> 02:15:12,283
 the correct time line.

1717
02:15:12,283 --> 02:15:13,316
 So I will give that on the

1718
02:15:13,316 --> 02:15:15,766
 post-production plan to you as well.

1719
02:15:18,383 --> 02:15:19,883
 Yeah, so these were

1720
02:15:19,883 --> 02:15:21,550
 some of my observations.

1721
02:15:22,649 --> 02:15:24,816
 Yes, let me do one video.

1722
02:15:24,816 --> 02:15:26,733
 Let me do one video with the

1723
02:15:26,733 --> 02:15:28,649
 post-production output

1724
02:15:28,966 --> 02:15:32,583
 and the plan and the input.

1725
02:15:33,216 --> 02:15:35,816
 Then if you see that this can be created

1726
02:15:35,816 --> 02:15:39,566
 with a plan, with the footages, then your

1727
02:15:39,566 --> 02:15:41,766
 questions will be solved.

1728
02:15:41,766 --> 02:15:42,466
 Is that correct?

1729
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:46,250
 And I show you how I do it on DaVinci

1730
02:15:46,250 --> 02:15:48,149
 Resolve, show all the

1731
02:15:48,149 --> 02:15:50,483
 steps and record myself.

1732
02:15:51,166 --> 02:15:51,983
 Will that be enough

1733
02:15:51,983 --> 02:15:53,716
 or is this not enough?

1734
02:15:57,233 --> 02:16:00,000
 I will give you the input, I will give

1735
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:01,816
 you the plan and I will give you the

1736
02:16:01,816 --> 02:16:04,050
 output, the final output.

1737
02:16:07,533 --> 02:16:09,050
 But Rifat, that is

1738
02:16:09,050 --> 02:16:10,533
 going to take time, right?

1739
02:16:11,216 --> 02:16:13,116
 So how long will that take?

1740
02:16:13,533 --> 02:16:15,550
 I will finish this at

1741
02:16:15,550 --> 02:16:16,766
 the end of this weekend.

1742
02:16:16,766 --> 02:16:17,766
 I will give it to you guys.

1743
02:16:19,550 --> 02:16:21,216
 Oh, only for the question.

1744
02:16:22,149 --> 02:16:22,350
 Yeah.

1745
02:16:23,149 --> 02:16:25,266
 Because I've already given all the screen

1746
02:16:25,266 --> 02:16:27,616
 captures, all the plan, you guys are

1747
02:16:27,616 --> 02:16:29,316
 seeing, you guys can't do it.

1748
02:16:29,316 --> 02:16:32,033
 I understand, I empathize and I will do

1749
02:16:32,033 --> 02:16:33,549
 it one and record the

1750
02:16:33,549 --> 02:16:34,666
 training for you guys.

1751
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:36,883
 You guys will take the training and do

1752
02:16:36,883 --> 02:16:37,733
 the post-production.

1753
02:16:41,666 --> 02:16:43,299
 That's my thought process.

1754
02:16:43,299 --> 02:16:45,333
 If you guys are unable to do it, somebody

1755
02:16:45,333 --> 02:16:47,033
 says they can do it.

1756
02:16:47,416 --> 02:16:48,533
 I will show you guys how

1757
02:16:48,533 --> 02:16:50,133
 to do it, use the AI. I

1758
02:16:50,133 --> 02:16:52,566
 will use the artificial intelligence,

1759
02:16:52,933 --> 02:16:54,983
 create the post-production plan,

1760
02:16:55,283 --> 02:16:55,950
 implement that

1761
02:16:55,950 --> 02:16:57,783
 post-production plan, show you.

1762
02:16:57,799 --> 02:16:59,933
 You guys that this is doable, you guys

1763
02:16:59,933 --> 02:17:01,033
 are using the horses.

1764
02:17:01,783 --> 02:17:03,216
 I will use the AI, the

1765
02:17:03,216 --> 02:17:05,350
 car, to go from A to B.

1766
02:17:05,666 --> 02:17:06,649
 Show you guys this

1767
02:17:06,649 --> 02:17:08,066
 can be done by the car.

1768
02:17:08,450 --> 02:17:10,783
 You guys will become less skeptic and

1769
02:17:10,783 --> 02:17:13,500
 say, okay, a car can go from New York to

1770
02:17:13,500 --> 02:17:15,733
 San Francisco and I don't need a horse.

1771
02:17:16,333 --> 02:17:17,466
 I will show the car.

1772
02:17:17,866 --> 02:17:18,866
 The car can move.

1773
02:17:18,866 --> 02:17:21,883
 I will use the AI on the post-production

1774
02:17:21,883 --> 02:17:23,933
 process for the planning.

1775
02:17:24,716 --> 02:17:27,183
 So you guys will be able to say, okay,

1776
02:17:27,683 --> 02:17:28,966
 this plan can be followed.

1777
02:17:29,233 --> 02:17:34,000
 I can use these footages and create them.

1778
02:17:34,766 --> 02:17:36,166
 If all of this is fine.

1779
02:17:36,450 --> 02:17:39,366
 So the idea of using AI is to

1780
02:17:39,366 --> 02:17:41,000
 work faster and smarter, right?

1781
02:17:41,500 --> 02:17:44,266
 So if this is going to delay for another

1782
02:17:44,266 --> 02:17:45,416
 two, three months is

1783
02:17:45,416 --> 02:17:47,083
 not making sense for us.

1784
02:17:47,583 --> 02:17:49,433
 No, no, on this project,

1785
02:17:49,950 --> 02:17:51,416
 I never delayed the time.

1786
02:17:51,600 --> 02:17:52,633
 You talked to my mates.

1787
02:17:52,883 --> 02:17:55,033
 I always gave for

1788
02:17:55,033 --> 02:17:57,566
 Sangha before everybody else.

1789
02:17:57,566 --> 02:17:59,766
 I always waited for the Starweaver site.

1790
02:18:00,350 --> 02:18:01,649
 You guys never ever

1791
02:18:01,649 --> 02:18:03,233
 have waited on my site.

1792
02:18:03,766 --> 02:18:05,783
 Zero time waited on my site.

1793
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:06,416
 Zero.

1794
02:18:07,799 --> 02:18:09,683
 I always gave it to my site.

1795
02:18:09,683 --> 02:18:10,916
 It is on your site.

1796
02:18:11,716 --> 02:18:15,766
 And I'm also okay to create the guides,

1797
02:18:16,049 --> 02:18:17,666
 how you guys are gonna do it.

1798
02:18:17,883 --> 02:18:19,033
 It is on your site.

1799
02:18:19,033 --> 02:18:20,100
 I'm okay to do that.

1800
02:18:21,133 --> 02:18:22,549
 I have no issue doing that.

1801
02:18:27,033 --> 02:18:29,483
 I will take my time, create the

1802
02:18:29,483 --> 02:18:32,433
 post-production plan, do one video edit

1803
02:18:32,433 --> 02:18:33,966
 and can, because it's

1804
02:18:33,966 --> 02:18:36,549
 only a six minute video.

1805
02:18:36,549 --> 02:18:37,799
 It will take my eight

1806
02:18:37,799 --> 02:18:39,333
 hours, my one weekend.

1807
02:18:39,916 --> 02:18:41,649
 I will be able to finish it off.

1808
02:18:41,649 --> 02:18:42,683
 I still understand.

1809
02:18:43,183 --> 02:18:45,983
 It will take eight hours for me to finish

1810
02:18:46,299 --> 02:18:48,883
 this post-production because I create

1811
02:18:48,883 --> 02:18:51,566
 YouTube videos weekly and it takes around

1812
02:18:51,566 --> 02:18:54,799
 eight hours for me to finish all my

1813
02:18:54,799 --> 02:18:57,250
 YouTube videos for the post-production.

1814
02:18:57,466 --> 02:18:59,866
 I'm not saying it's an easy process, but

1815
02:18:59,866 --> 02:19:01,466
 somebody needs to guide you.

1816
02:19:01,466 --> 02:19:02,783
 I have already created this.

1817
02:19:02,933 --> 02:19:05,416
 much of a guidance I can go ahead and

1818
02:19:05,416 --> 02:19:07,766
 complete the remaining and you guys will

1819
02:19:07,766 --> 02:19:10,299
 be able to see it and if I have any gaps

1820
02:19:10,299 --> 02:19:13,500
 I will fix it in the processes of there

1821
02:19:13,500 --> 02:19:16,500
 could be gaps that I have that I'm saying

1822
02:19:16,500 --> 02:19:19,450
 there's a car use it but I'm not showing

1823
02:19:19,450 --> 02:19:22,583
 the accelerator I'm not showing the wheel

1824
02:19:22,583 --> 02:19:25,266
 and it might not make sense if you always

1825
02:19:25,266 --> 02:19:28,066
 ridden a horse you have never seen a car

1826
02:19:28,066 --> 02:19:30,733
 you have never seen a wheel it might not

1827
02:19:30,733 --> 02:19:33,149
 make sense I will show it to you because

1828
02:19:33,149 --> 02:19:34,416
 I'm using artificial

1829
02:19:34,416 --> 02:19:36,049
 intelligence to be able to do it.

1830
02:19:36,049 --> 02:19:40,000
 So let's do one thing what I will do is

1831
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:48,233
 I'll just go through the yeah so what we

1832
02:19:48,233 --> 02:19:52,000
 can do is yeah just allow me one minute

1833
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:57,100
 so what we can do so what we can do I

1834
02:19:57,100 --> 02:20:04,000
 think somebody's playing somebody's

1835
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:04,716
 playing but there's an

1836
02:20:04,716 --> 02:20:05,866
 interruption from Arin.

1837
02:20:07,600 --> 02:20:11,000
 Can you check your background?

1838
02:20:12,100 --> 02:20:14,933
 Hari wants to add something yes Hari what

1839
02:20:14,933 --> 02:20:16,866
 is it that you want to say?

1840
02:20:17,350 --> 02:20:20,883
 No for the in that existing storyboard so

1841
02:20:20,883 --> 02:20:24,483
 it is possible to add so that image if

1842
02:20:24,483 --> 02:20:26,149
 you are showing means just take the audio

1843
02:20:26,149 --> 02:20:29,866
 part so from this audio part to this one

1844
02:20:29,866 --> 02:20:32,299
 show this image or firstly we have to

1845
02:20:32,299 --> 02:20:34,216
 show the video means just make a number

1846
02:20:34,216 --> 02:20:37,066
 of that for a firstly we have to show the

1847
02:20:37,066 --> 02:20:39,100
 video means make it number one and the

1848
02:20:39,100 --> 02:20:41,000
 next we if we have to show the image

1849
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:43,649
 means make it number two and just place

1850
02:20:43,649 --> 02:20:47,100
 the audio I will do I think that will be

1851
02:20:47,100 --> 02:20:50,049
 easy yes I will have using number code

1852
02:20:50,049 --> 02:20:52,933
 them in each scene so you know which one

1853
02:20:52,933 --> 02:20:55,666
 comes one two three four five and I will

1854
02:20:55,666 --> 02:20:58,033
 put that on my post-production plan and

1855
02:20:58,033 --> 02:21:01,583
 guide there I think that will be that

1856
02:21:01,583 --> 02:21:03,950
 will be easy so instead of creating a new

1857
02:21:03,950 --> 02:21:07,216
 one like I'll share my ones.

1858
02:21:08,049 --> 02:21:10,466
 Suppose when I guess you got me screen.

1859
02:21:11,183 --> 02:21:11,716
 Yes, I can.

1860
02:21:12,466 --> 02:21:13,433
 Yes, I can.

1861
02:21:13,433 --> 02:21:16,549
 When it comes to this one slide 5, so we

1862
02:21:16,549 --> 02:21:17,483
 have this audio part.

1863
02:21:17,716 --> 02:21:20,483
 So for this slide 5, first we have to

1864
02:21:20,483 --> 02:21:21,549
 show the video part.

1865
02:21:21,549 --> 02:21:22,149
 It means just to

1866
02:21:22,149 --> 02:21:23,666
 mention this one audio part.

1867
02:21:24,033 --> 02:21:26,416
 So from exactly which audio from which

1868
02:21:26,416 --> 02:21:28,383
 were to which one we have to show this

1869
02:21:28,383 --> 02:21:31,033
 video and this image is also there.

1870
02:21:31,299 --> 02:21:33,366
 So we have to show the image this after

1871
02:21:33,366 --> 02:21:35,166
 the video means just to mention it as a

1872
02:21:35,166 --> 02:21:38,416
 number 2 and just to copy and paste that

1873
02:21:38,416 --> 02:21:40,233
 audio part near to that image.

1874
02:21:40,866 --> 02:21:43,250
 We can pick it up that one easily.

1875
02:21:43,766 --> 02:21:45,833
 Alright, I will give you the number codes

1876
02:21:45,833 --> 02:21:49,683
 and how it's going to get edited out on

1877
02:21:49,683 --> 02:21:53,683
 AI generated video production plan and I

1878
02:21:53,683 --> 02:21:56,633
 will go over that video production plan

1879
02:21:56,633 --> 02:21:59,649
 and execute it and make sure that it is

1880
02:21:59,649 --> 02:22:02,266
 usable and you will be able to see the

1881
02:22:02,299 --> 02:22:03,566
 output, the numbers,

1882
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:05,833
 the plan and the input.

1883
02:22:06,133 --> 02:22:08,066
 So you have everything to be able to

1884
02:22:08,066 --> 02:22:10,333
 create one video and give me a go at but

1885
02:22:10,333 --> 02:22:13,183
 it will take me this weekend to be able

1886
02:22:13,183 --> 02:22:15,500
 to complete it because I'm traveling.

1887
02:22:15,766 --> 02:22:17,166
 I'm in a hotel right now.

1888
02:22:17,166 --> 02:22:19,799
 I will go back to Cambridge and produce

1889
02:22:19,799 --> 02:22:22,500
 it so you will be able to see it.

1890
02:22:22,799 --> 02:22:25,333
 And you need to do is

1891
02:22:25,333 --> 02:22:28,633
 while I'm working on it.

1892
02:22:28,633 --> 02:22:30,883
 Who is the Haruki?

1893
02:22:30,883 --> 02:22:31,366
 I will

1894
02:22:32,933 --> 02:22:34,149
 Haruki Shannon.

1895
02:22:34,666 --> 02:22:37,450
 I will give you the I will give you the

1896
02:22:37,450 --> 02:22:39,466
 links during the

1897
02:22:39,466 --> 02:22:41,549
 process of how I am doing it.

1898
02:22:41,866 --> 02:22:44,266
 So you can give me the feedback while we

1899
02:22:44,266 --> 02:22:45,266
 are working together.

1900
02:22:46,033 --> 02:22:49,133
 I will give the update to Haruki Shinny

1901
02:22:49,133 --> 02:22:52,000
 or I will put this to this channel to

1902
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:55,733
 this chat all the steps on this chat so

1903
02:22:55,733 --> 02:22:58,983
 everybody will be able to see what I'm

1904
02:22:58,983 --> 02:23:01,033
 doing and how I'm going through so you

1905
02:23:01,033 --> 02:23:03,966
 guys will be able to give feedback live.

1906
02:23:04,333 --> 02:23:05,916
 I don't know if you guys are working in

1907
02:23:05,916 --> 02:23:07,466
 the weekend, but I had

1908
02:23:07,466 --> 02:23:08,683
 to do it on the weekend.

1909
02:23:09,666 --> 02:23:11,783
 So because I'm working in IBM

1910
02:23:13,250 --> 02:23:16,133
 At the moment I would not have the time

1911
02:23:16,133 --> 02:23:19,733
 to do it on today till the weekend But I

1912
02:23:19,733 --> 02:23:22,466
 will add the plans over there

1913
02:23:23,750 --> 02:23:27,366
 Okay, okay, let's do that and a real date

1914
02:23:27,366 --> 02:23:35,299
 for that For supporting us

1915
02:23:35,850 --> 02:23:37,683
 For now, I know it's not easy.

1916
02:23:37,683 --> 02:23:39,549
 It's a very transitional time.

1917
02:23:39,549 --> 02:23:43,216
 Let's use the AI I'm using the Gemini 3

1918
02:23:43,216 --> 02:23:46,916
 right now to be able to do this And I

1919
02:23:46,916 --> 02:23:49,000
 will give all the steps so you guys will

1920
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:51,833
 be able to Trigger all the prompts that

1921
02:23:51,833 --> 02:23:54,549
 I'm using to be able to create on your

1922
02:23:54,549 --> 02:23:56,666
 site and use it on the other video

1923
02:23:56,933 --> 02:23:59,466
 Productions and this is going to speed up

1924
02:23:59,466 --> 02:24:02,450
 not only this video but every video that

1925
02:24:02,450 --> 02:24:03,783
 the Starweaver creates

1926
02:24:04,833 --> 02:24:05,916
 Hopefully this process.

1927
02:24:05,916 --> 02:24:06,716
 Okay

1928
02:24:08,416 --> 02:24:09,266

1929
02:24:11,683 --> 02:24:13,383
