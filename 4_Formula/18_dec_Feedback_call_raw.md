I gave a short of everyone. You already have met Swati, Sanjia and Hanuk. Hari is from our production team and Swati is more from the post-production team. So Hari right now edited your demo screen share that you shared.(...) And then we shared it with Sanjia and Hanuk for the final review.(...) So then Hanuk has a few observations on the screen share.

(...)

The way you are creating is still okay but the concept on which it's been...

created is not being understandable as per my understanding of Hanuk.

(...)

So I'll hand it over to Hanuk. Hanuk can explain better as to what is the issue. And before that, Hari, can you play that video for us to understand that the audio and video are not syncing. So in one of the slides,(...) as per Hari,(...) slide 6 audio is coming in slide 7 audio, something like that.

(...)

All right, very good. Let's try it and see it and try to understand it because what I did was, if I share my screen, before we start, I created a video around this as well.(...) So you guys should be able to see this. Can you guys see my screen?

(...)

Yes. So what I tried to do was I tried to edit it myself so I will be able to see it myself as well, put myself into the same shoes with the post-production team. So what I did was,(...) in a nutshell,(...) on here,

(...)

first of all, what I did was I gave you guys Google Drive folders for everything, for the voiceover. So the voiceover can be changed at any place. It is at the bottom. There is a voiceover. So the voiceover can be easily tracked everywhere. So how can it be tracked the voiceover? If you guys see the file names, there is a voiceover file name. And that voiceover file name is on Storyboard. But do not use the Storyboard to line up the audio. The audio is in the voiceover audio file. But how are you going to put the voiceover audio to the correct slide?(...) That key lands in the slide. So all of this combo has at the bottom a voiceover posted.(...) So once you look at the voiceover post-

You know that how it's going to land because I put these voiceovers. I did not edit them. I put a Rough voiceover so it will be one second behind one second after so they had to be mapped with these voiceovers at the bottom post-its and I put all these Screen captures with the number coding on here So in the combat you should be able to find it with the number codes and the number codes are already placed In the output slides so they are very straightforward and I put all the references into one file and created this into a Video format that could be easily found if this says scene 5 that it is the fifth scene In the system, and how do you place it on timeline? I put the storyboard as you guys will be able to listen it and do it easily And all of these scenes have seen numbers Inside them so you know which scene you are at without even looking at combo But combo is there to be able to support you I put this into the wind result You will be able to see the scene number as for s5 s6 as we

(...)

Start off the scene. This is the rough audio as you guys see scene is here But there's one second gap you need to move this to the left hand side There is one second gap you need to move this to the left hand side. I did not cut this I expected the post-production team to cut it and place it, but don't forget. There's also the Posted notes which has the voiceovers on top of tanda so that in the editing It should be able to go there And you are not going to use the voiceover on the storyboard You are going to use the voiceover in the module one to be able to place it properly So there's a clean voiceover as well that I recorded in audiosity

you place the footage for the screen capture. You know the footage ID and you know the scene over there. You are going to meet the storyboard, place it in the correct place and set the screen capture over there. Then you are going to collect the visuals and do a sanity check because I put the visuals onto the combo by going into combo and being able to download it by right clicking on it and do a download selection on here in a very easy manner. So that's going to help you be able to do it

(...)

directly over here. So there's a voiceover screen capture over there. So that will let you be able to download it as well. So that is in a nutshell. Which part is the problematic part for you, Hanukkah, in here to be able to not do it?

(...)

I'll tell you, see the thing is,

(...)

now like once this gets edited,(...) once the audio is in sync, maybe I might have a different opinion, but see the thing is still the problems which I foresee is

(...)

whatever you were mentioning in the narration, right?(...) And whatever is there in the screen, like I understand that those things are relatable because we have additional information,

(...)

not excess information on the screen, but the narration is talking about some generic things and it's much more abstract, not kind of specific. This is what I felt. And as I've already said that the voiceover and demo is,

(...)

just a second, let me complete, maybe you can add after that. Otherwise I'll lose my train of thought if that's okay with you. So as I was saying, the voiceover and the demo was not.

modern sync, first of all. So you said that maybe we might have to adjust it a little bit, then that particular thing would be solved. But still, as I've said, the second problem was that there were a lot of things on the screen, but I can understand that from a technical point of view, maybe as a subject matter expert, you might find that this is something which is kind of, these would be relatable things. But from a learner's perspective, or when I look at it things,(...) I cannot relate with what you are saying. There are a few things that are there on the screen, which I can see and what you are saying, but those are not in a direct way. All right, and the demos, which I see, right? So the demos also like what I expect is that the demo should be for a concrete example. All right, so and then for a given concrete example, you would have to kind of divide the demo into different steps, like step one, step two, step three. All right,(...) and then maybe in step one, you would say that, okay, install this. All right, maybe there was a step wherein you go on to GitHub and then over there, you would have, instead of doing it locally, you are adding some code spaces, you are doing it on code spaces. I do not know, I'm not a technical person over here to comment on that. So maybe, so the thing is you can just take an example,

(...)

you can do the demo for an example scenario, hypothetical scenario or a hypothetical example, the different steps involved, and alternatively, you can mention the different alternative steps, like you can do this locally as well, but the focus should be on the example scenario that you have taken to meet the objective. And accordingly, the steps would have to be broken down. I'm not expecting you to show the entire execution of those steps. You just mentioned the important pointers or the codes or the steps that the learner would have to perform for a given major step, right?

like the first step would be maybe for installing something. All right, and then that is where you show the code for installing, okay, and this is, I'm just randomly speaking over here. I'm not sure if this applies to your demo or not, but there was a step for installing installation. I've seen that. So you need not to show the entire process of installation. You just say that use this code for installing and then you just skip to that part where the installation is complete and then you move on to the next step. Maybe next step would be kind of maybe integrating onto the GitHub or doing it on code spaces or locally. I'm not sure. All right, so I want, so at present, it is very difficult to understand the flow of the demo. You know, like what are the steps that the learner would have to kind of perform to attain the objective of the video, right? Maybe if we are trying to build something over here, so that building should, building that particular thing should involve one, two, three steps, all right? These steps which would be, which can be applied for any such example, all right? Any such example. So you would have to take a concrete example. You would have, your focus should be that and maybe alternatively, you can mention few things that can be covered. So what I felt was this was,(...) there were portions in the screen shares which felt more like conceptual portions, all right? Because there were generic discussions going on. You are talking about generic things, all right? So those things would have to be covered in a conceptual,

(...)

because okay, these are the techniques that are involved. That's fine. You need not to dig deep into it. You can tell that, okay, these are the alternatives that we have. So that's fine. And yeah, so this is how I want you to approach the demo because it's very difficult to follow at this particular point. You can go ahead and add your points. You talked about only two points. I'm recording this and I will go over it to make sure that I understood.

First, you said you are unable to put the voiceovers. This is the first part.

(...)

The second part you said you had a flow problem.(...) Is that correct? Two points?

(...)

Only two. Let's address the first one, the voiceovers. So the voiceovers is impossible for you not to find. Impossible.(...) Because what I'm doing is I put the voiceovers onto post-its. And I read the post-its, A1, it starts here and goes to a transition line. It says, now let's look at our targets. If you are able to follow the Kamba, either on Kamba.com or on the storyboard video that I gave you, by scene number, then you will be able to find it. So the thing is, the post-production team has S5, S6, all of them next to each other. I tried to find it. I find it. I'm able to because I read these things and I put the audio under them, but not one-to-one, but very, very close to each other. There is a cut, there is a start. There is a cut, there is a start. There is a cut, there is a start. They are not 100%, but there is a cut, there is a start. So if I take it here and if I play it, I will be able to hear attack, we apply perturbation, we aren't changing the image. If I hit, I will play, I will hear visuals, adversarial samples, they are looking similar. I'm not going to talk like yourself. I will talk about one topic, then go to the other one. Please answer what is the issue here.

(...)

How do you can get?

(...)

Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So this one, I got it that one. So we can understand it.

(...)

So we can fix this one as you are giving the audio in that story about itself. So right now we have the problem is if you go to slide five, so the audio it is coming up to slide six, it is coming. Yeah, then cut it. Just go to. Then cut it. Yeah.

(...)

I gave it to you. Yeah. Cut it then.(...) I understand this talks on limitations on here and this talks on the environment. This is not a simple cut, but cut it. I put them over here. So when I say the environment, we have to decide you are going to see the images here and you are going to see the video and I can try you. Yeah. Yeah. After the slide five, we can make a cut and we can move the remaining part and from slide six, we can match the audio part. So that is fine. Yes. So I gave you again, I can I give you that and I can share that one. Yes. I gave you three, four things on here. First of all, the voiceover is a screenshot in an image, a video to place it over and also extra visuals for you to go ahead, download and make more sense out of it. So you will be able to say, okay, Rufat is talking about this and I know what he is talking about. Maybe I should show this image, show this one or show this video that you will be able to do either one of them. So is the point one clear or this is still too hard for you guys to map and take?(...) See no, no, no, see, see, yeah. I think the audio part,(...) Hari can fix but my concern is if you go to the slide one, I'll give you, I'll tell you the example of what I'm talking about. When I say things are not in syncy,(...) whatever you're mentioning in the narration, right, it clearly does not discuss everything that is present.

This isn't on the scale. Okay. Of course. Well, here you mentioned the objectives, right? Of course. Just give me a second. This is a moot board and a storyboard for you to show what is up, but I'm reading the posted notes.(...) I read the posted notes. Wait, wait. I read the posted notes explaining what is here with a transition line. So there is always a flow. Which answers your second question?

(...)

Okay, just give me a second. So over here, you're saying in the narration, you're saying welcome to the Evasion Attacks Lab. Today our objectives is simple but dangerous. We are going to break a production ready AI model using nothing but math and noise. So this is there in your voiceover. But over here on screen, I can say KR1 reproducibility, then KR2. So this is code clarity. So these things are not mentioned. This is not mentioned or this is not talked about in the narration, the corresponding narration. So what we are going to do is, I'm telling you what we are going to do is show a big picture of your objective is simple and dangerous. Break your production ready model using nothing but math and noise. So that's my voiceover. I'm going to go ahead and do all these objectives. I'm not taking everything from this image. This image is a storyboard. You can use it, you might not use it.(...) So this is a storyboard image. You can use the math and noise. You can use the Evasion Attack Labs as a big image that is coming on here, but not everything. You do not have to use everything. This is a storyboard.

(...)

All of these images, it includes. Once I go here, our first key is the environmental. We will deploy a fully reproducible.

Attackers Playbook repository for FGSM, which is the hello world. It says the hello world. This is not going to be used. What I'm doing is I created the flow first.(...) My goal,(...) Honuki, the main goal is creating the flow. I created objectives first.(...) Then I created an environment. So the person has an environment. Then I created the user interfaces. Then I created all the formulas, all the steps that they are going to follow. Then I created all the symbols that are used. They are using AI to install the symbols. Then I showed them the errors. Then I showed them how they are going to test it. So there is two flows. There is one flow inside the narration.(...) There is the second flow going through the one slide. There is the other slide and there is an overall flow. Yeah, that is understood.

(...)

My concern is only...(...) That are already being designed and placed.

(...)

See, I understand. See, there are transitions from one slide to the other slide. That is completely there. I'm not denying that fact. My concern is like I already said, you have provided some images. So the video which I have received is the final produced video is the video that contains all these images along with the voiceover. And if we include all the information that you provided in the slides... Not all the information. No, no, no, no, no. I said you guys are going to do editing post-production. Not all of the information. You are not going to include this title all the time. You are not going to include this image all the time. You are not going to include this post-node scene number as an editor. But I can edit it with the footage that I have provided. You are going to listen. You are going to see and then edit something and create another...

storyline which lines up with audience such as in here what I say for example macOS users you are going to show them MacBook and one M2 chips you are going to show and one M2 chips often facing TensorFlow capability you are going to show TensorFlow I am showing the download on here might not have the visual studio code this part is the visual studio code if you want I can also give those images on here but I understand that you guys find this am I correct that's the challenge basically Rifat that yeah so basically as in like you are the subject matter expert the way you know the content like it we won't be able to exactly pick up which ones which parts to use and which parts to not use like(...) will it be very difficult for you to provide us the demo because that way we will we will be able to meet Korsera's expectation to to use demonstration instead of images and your work and our work also I didn't only put images hold on hold on we are mixing I also put the videos and I gave you 10 different videos on here with all the hand zones I gave you guys the screen captures and the videos the audience knows what they are going to do you guys have images sound videos and the flow on post-production go ahead sir we are facing the problem here so if we sound in some slides you have included images and the videos also so when it comes to for this audio first we have to show the image or first we have to show the video photos so that editors are facing the that issue so from exactly we have to show which one anyway first we have to show the video or first we have to show the image

This was that doubt we are having. So do you guys want me to write to you guys a post-production plan on here, how you guys are going to edit it? No, no, that'll even, that'll add one more layer to,(...) one more layer to the already, there are too many layers right now at this screen share. The best and the easiest and the most effective way would be, guys, please tell me if I'm wrong, if you record the demo for us.

(...)

I recorded the demo. Exactly, of course I love the models. These are the recorded demos.

(...)

These are the recorded demos I gave. Okay, the first.(...) Tense screen capture videos and put them onto the mood board. But for us to be able to reach here, I'm talking beforehand, before this slide, it says environment. Let's talk about the environment to run these attacks. We need a setup that supports a Python library, such as TensorFlow image processing without crashing your laptop. But here is your constraint. I'm talking about this, showing them the TensorFlow install, then taking them to here, local setups, open face, hell-rung Python versions, missing libraries. I'm showing them the GitHub code space.

(...)

Yeah, yeah, I referred, I'm asking so far this slide five, if we have to, for this audio, we have to show only the video part.

(...)

No, video and image. You have two images also. No, no, video and image. So that also we have to show. We have to show the image. But is it so that when you are-- Only we are having the issue. So where exactly where we have to show the image and where we have to show the video. So that confusion we are having.

(...)

If you guys want,(...) I already gave you guys all the storyboards. I can also provide the edited version,

(...)

post-production version of this video and show you guys how I edit it.

I can also edit this and also write the post-production. Then you can take it and understand, okay, this is end-to-end where the image comes in, where the audio comes in. I can also do that in the post-production, but I will finish all the post-production edit.

(...)

No, no, actually post-production, our team can handle, that's not a problem, but wouldn't it be easier for you to record the demo than to edit everything? Swati, I think the issue here is that the demo is recorded, like those videos that are embedded are the hands-on demo, right? Yes. That are there, that comes in parts. But there is a part of voiceover which needs to have

(...)

our developed slides, like in the beginning, like we were talking about Mac and whatever, then we put up a Mac image or whatsoever, that part we have to do. And then for the current slide, there is a portion of the image that comes first, then the demo plays, the image that is attached. Rifat, am I right on this part?

(...)

Yes, but what I'm thinking is right now, how they are looking at it is without putting the cognitive part, they just want to be able to, I also understand, this is an advanced course, not an easy course. So what I can do is, I can use the footages that I gave you guys, finish one video's edit, because there is going to be 10 modules, and show you guys the plan and how I edited it, and only use the files that I've given you guys, and also find MacBook images and do the placements, and it will be easier for you guys, which steps I have gone through, because there is three stages of the flow. One flow with the audio, one flow within all video structure, and one flow with the artifacts inside the scenes.

I think what you guys are having an issue is, I did not include the artifacts inside the scenes flow. You guys are unable to place them. Did I understand it correctly? I gave you guys the title, I gave you guys the voiceover, I gave you guys the videos and the images, but I did not give you guys how it is flowing.(...) So it is creating a hard time because you guys are not subject matter experts. Which one you guys are going to show and you guys are unable to make the decision on what to show, what not to show.

(...)

Yeah, exactly that is the point. Now, even if you'll edit one video, when we come to the next one, how will we again understand what has to come with?(...) So the question is how we as laymen understand.(...) First of all, once I finish the editing of this video, I will have two things. One, editing plan. The second, an output that I like that you guys like. You guys can say, "I like this edit, I don't like this edit." But we will also edit the edit plan. Then you guys will say, "Okay, just give me the edit plan in the next videos and we will edit through this." That edit plan will include artifact by artifact, meaning this lower third will come, this image will come, this screen capture will come, and that output will be at the output video capture that you guys will be able to see. Two outputs, one final video output and then the planned video output. So all of them will be in one video.(...) So, Rifat, then if that is the only solution, Hano, please correct me if I'm wrong and Sangya, please correct me if I'm wrong. So you don't have to edit exact thing, just give us a rough structure because I don't know.

want you to put in a lot of effort because anyways we are going to redo it here. We have professional editors who do it. So just give us a rough structure in terms of so that it gives us clarity what comes where. I already gave the rough structure. In a video if you can give us the rough structure. I already gave the rough structure. But since it got very confusing since they were canvas lights there were a lot of confusion and mismatch of the audio. So if that only you can put it in a video. No what I will do is. Please correct me if I'm wrong. I will edit this on DaVinci Resolve and record myself while editing it. So you guys will be able to see how I edit it. How I do my selections. And to end with the plan. So I will be like the video production assistant on the editing side. So it will be easier.(...) I think if we will see you like somewhere in the screen on the screen that will be a little problem because we would want to have the full HD version of it. No no I will give two of it. And then definitely we will find you that at our end. I will give one video output as the edited version. The second I will give you guys the plan. The third I will give you guys how I edit it on DaVinci Resolve.(...) Is

(...)

that all right? I think Swati is absolutely right. I think this is causing too much work for you for us. And if we calculate the time that we are taking for the review process itself it's adding to a lot of time for this course. So we want to simplify the process rather than you investing so much time into it. Because like you said time is money. Let's do it that way. So we don't want anybody to invest extra effort into you know editing then us viewing it and then going forward to it. Although that is the process of learning we'd say. But as a business model I would say.

that we will have to be a little more conscious on the time that we're investing in one video production of only one screen share.

(...)

If the easy way out, if it could be, was that while,(...) that is my idea of it. Can you just put, like you put it on the Canva board, you put every, this thing, every line of your script and then given us a video and a photo. And it's all on one Canva. So that is what is getting us confused. I already gave my cover. So rather than that, can you? I already gave my cover and voiceover or post it lost with scene IDs. And the audio is very close to the scenes.

(...)

So like in one of the, one slide, there is an audio, there is an image and there's a voiceover and then there's a script part of it, right? Now all of that, where to put what is the question here?(...) So to simplify that, can we have a simple,

(...)

breakdown of the sentence that you're speaking and what image you want to get in front of it? Just that much. All right, you guys want the plan. With this sentence, you want this video to come in. I will create the post production plan. That post production plan is, I have done it multiple times. I will give you guys the post production plan.

(...)

Where image, when the audio comes in, I will give you guys the post production plan. It's not very, very hard because I have the video, I have the audio. I will go to chat GPT, create me a post production plan and put it there so you guys will be able to use the AI and see there's a post production plan and the post production plan will include all the images, audio that should be displayed on here. I can definitely give that, yes.(...) And it will not take too much of my time. And I will use the AI to create the post production.

plan with the existing stuff that we already have on the scene.

(...)

Okay, I just have one. Yeah, I'll just tell one more thing. See the thing over here is like if you're switching in between a lot of images,(...) a lot of videos in between. So I see that the voiceover is not very long. All right. The corresponding narration, it's hardly of two, three lines or so. Okay, so there is not enough settlement time.(...) Just give me a second. So there is not enough settlement time for the learner to kind of comprehend of what comes on the screen. Like I see there are a lot of code snippets, right? So there are a lot of codes involved. Like if you say that, okay, for visual studio code, we're going to show this image. All right. So there are a lot of codes involved in that.(...) So it would just come and go. It would not add any learning value for the learner, right? So there is not enough time that we are spending on that image, the different codes that are written in that. Like so, like it's very difficult from a learner's perspective to kind of understand what is written in that. Hold on, hold on, hold on. So that is what I meant when things are not in secret. Hold on, okay. Don't forget. This is, I compressed this video from,(...) this is right now at six, seven minutes, once it's all edited out, the, what's her name? The mom met once only three minutes. This is an advanced course because we are going to create 10 of them.

(...)

We are compressing them. In the future, I will even compress it further. There is right now 40 scenes. In my future ones, I will only create 10 scenes, not 40.(...) This is an advanced level course, but we are trying to fit into 60 minute timeline, not six hours timeline.

(...)

Do you understand what I mean? Yeah, so that is what, so I completely understand.

trying to go fast.(...) If I shoot this in one go, it will cost it one hour. Then the mom mate will say one video capture one hour. What are you doing?(...) Do you understand?

(...)

Maybe what we can. Yeah, I understand. See, like I'll tell you. So if you go to them up,

(...)

don't forget I speeded up these voice captures, the screen captures. They are in 3x, 4x. Don't forget such as once I go to these videos, if you play them, you are going to realize these are running very, very fast and down below. If we can't hear you, you're on mute. Once if you look at these screen captures, these are in 4x, 3x. These ones are also going very fast. Let's just take this as an example. So let's see the voice over corresponding to this particular screen. Let's just review this slide. I'll tell my observations on this. Okay, you are saying you could start. What's the voice over? It's right up on Python 3 and the connection status and we are live. Time to run it. I'm running it in the background and at the end I'm going to see the Python 3 online that comes on here.(...) First of all, we asked the AI, artificial intelligence, for us to run it. This is the first thing that comes on. Then there is this video that shows Python that runs. This is the start and this is the end.

(...)

And okay, so this is of how much time? This screen share, this is of how much duration?(...) Now see this screen share, this is of how many seconds?(...) 16 seconds, 16.7. This is of screen. And see the voice over is not enough. There is a 16 seconds of

and then like you're saying and and and it's very like if you could pull up the voiceover corresponding to this which which you have written.

(...)

See your journalist connected your right up you will be able to see the Python 3 server ensure your kernel is yes and this is where we show it. This is going to be shown at the start we run this you're saying in the top right in the top right you should see Python where can I see it on the top right? It should be here on the point.

(...)

Python running here.

(...)

It says running type, right corner. It's on the left. So left.

(...)

OK, so the voiceover says see so see like like we're just reviewing one slide. So this is what so then the voiceover says like as editors they do not know where actually the Python program is running. So the voiceover says the learner would be looking for where the Python program is running because the narration says that on the type top right corner there is this Python 3 running like they would not be. I'm just saying from a.

(...)

Editor's job is to make sure this is usable.

(...)

Yes, I understand that editor's job is thinking and making the best out of it. Sometimes I read the same sentence multiple times. Editor's job is cut the ones that are not going to get used and only use the one that is going to be used. But these are very technical. They can understand like what what is that we want to. There are multiple things on the We want to have your expertise.

(...)

So we delete the right.

Well,(...) but they won't be able to... No, no, that is easy or post-production. What if something is deleted which is very crucial as per you? That is easy or post-production.(...) Delete the right keyword,(...) only use the top keyword. It is easy. You use your mind. But they are not...(...) My post-production team is not refered. They are not away from you. So they won't be able to know what to delete. That is the struggle that we are facing.

(...)

I think we need to have you on a call while we are editing. You know, like what can we take? Yes, let's edit together.(...) Okay. Hanoi, I will connect to you. We can edit together. That's also fine.(...) I can help you edit. I do not do editing. Like I just reviewed the final video.(...) I just reviewed the final video. So I'm not part of editing, no? So I'm not involved in that process. I get the final video for reviewing. Okay, one last thing, one more thing. So there is one more line which you said, "ensure the kernel is connected," right? So for that, you're saying there is a 16 seconds of demo.

(...)

Now,(...) where is that process? Like how would the learner ensure?(...) But you're actually showing... So I think the narration should be in a different way.

(...)

Maybe see, this is how you would have to connect the kernel. You have that 16 seconds of demo. Correct me if I'm right or wrong. Because see, it's very difficult for the learner to comprehend like how are they actually connecting the kernel, how they should ensure it. Unless and until if you have shown it and there is a corresponding voiceover to that, they will not be able to understand. So that is what I'm saying. So I... So this is good though. But I will do, if I was your position, I will create a three second animation and put a kernel connected message on top and give it and amplify it. So they understand that the kernel connection is very, very important.

(...)

Did you hear me?

(...)

Yeah, I heard you.

(...)

Yes, so that's why people use the animation.(...) But we have a limited budget. We have limited time because we cannot shoot this for one hour. It's a screen capture. That's our constraint. But we need to have a structure that creates this. We need to have screen captures and we have 10 different tools that goes in and out. So we use the post-production magic to be able to make this work. That is the whole game. The whole game is we use the post-production magic, use the production data, stitch it together so the learner can understand this. I'm not saying the post-production team is not telling a story line. They are also telling another story line. Everybody is telling a story line, but I understand you are having a hard time doing this. I will give you a post-production plan. I will produce one and I will record my video production steps. Then I guess in the post-production plan, you will have everything. If you are saying, "Rofat, you gave me the post-production plan." You produced it, but it doesn't work out in a way that I expect. And it is still not understandable by the end users. I will fix it again and we will have a post-production plan ready for you. So it is easier for you to edit this. This is where I am at right now from this output for this video. And I wanted to have this call multiple times at MAMet because I understood that you guys might have a hard time. And I want to help you guys out to make sure we are going to do 10 videos like this on this advanced level course. And this course is going to be taken by the audience of OpenAI.

Invidia the people who write the artificial intelligence chips and the large language models these Discourses for them this course is not for a Python developer that will come in and write Python We understand this course is how they are going to secure those models this(...) the trillion for the trillion dollar companies this course is not for the General audience do you guys understand this is an advanced level course how they secure their models?

(...)

Is that clear Yeah,(...) exactly highly technical like one suggestion instead of doing these two three things you can just give us a rough structure It could be even 10 15 minutes long with the screen shares and your voiceover

(...)

And We just we'll fine-tune it visually we'll add whichever element is required We'll make the those elements will create them in after effects or canva or in Premiere Pro wherever is needed my team will create a Visually like beautify it and then like the structure you can give us are you guys using the AI?

(...)

Wasting your time and giving us three things What I will do is I will go use the AI to create a post-production plan Read it fix it and give it to you guys I will use artificial intelligence to be able to create the post-production plan and make it sense and Make sure all the artifacts that are mentioned there are inside these video slides and they are in the outputs

(...)

That is what I will do

(...)

So there is no gaps because the AI will create a post-production plan and can't yeah, absolutely my concern my Son then again will go back to what if that doesn't work as well and we again will come back to the same thing(...) No, no if there is a plan and if I already

the post-production team cannot run away because there is the produced video and there is the plan and there is the footages, input, system and an output. Where is the post-production team gonna run? There is no way to run.

(...)

I use the input, I use the plan and I create an output.

(...)

Ali, we want to start on this project as soon as possible.(...) Yeah, very good.(...) I will create your post-production plan as soon as possible with the output.

(...)

That's alright, I will create it. So you will give us the rough structure? No, no,(...) I will give you the final output, I will give you the plan and the artifacts and show a video how they are mapping it and how I produce the output.

(...)

So I will create a course to create a post-production video just for this course so they can follow up the video and while the artifacts are there, if I am able to do it post-production, you guys should be able to do it as well.

(...)

By watching the video, we are creating video courses. I will create the video course to do post-production.

(...)

And that will work out, right? I will give you the input, the artifacts. I am a little skeptical because if we get too many files again, then there will be too much confusion, might as well just get one file and we will fine tune it and we will do everything and beautify it and shorten it and make it as per the script.

(...)

But we should have that file. I think Swati, Rifatib, what Swati is saying, we can do that, I think that will be the best. If we get one file with everything and then maybe it's 10 minutes long, 15 minutes long, that's fine. We will trim it down as and when based on Swati and her team's understanding. That will be the easiest way of doing this.

If they gave one file, they couldn't trim it out. That's the problem.

(...)

No, no, no. Not in the form of Kamba or Kanva, but in the form of a file only. I also gave that as well. I also gave that as well. There's a storyboard one with the audio in it, with everything that is shown. That's the thing. It's too many files.

(...)

Yes, I will give you one post-production output, the final video, with no editors used. That's all we need, that all we request from you. Yes, I will give the post-production output, the edited version, the plan and other stuff. You guys will understand this could be done by using these footages. He gave us the plan and all the steps and then go in the behind and think about it. This is where I am right now. Because if I can show that this is doable with the video production, then it will be able to say, "Okay, this is doable." But our main goal is to make sure that what Honoke is saying is also important. This is understandable by the learners.(...) Once I finish one video, full post-production, we are going to say, "All right, this can be done. This is understandable and this is usable." I also understand Honoke's points there. There are some gaps. I will find those gaps. I will find those gaps and put them to the post-production plan. The post-production plan will include all those steps as well. There is no gap. If we are able to confirm the first video, if I can do the editing of the first video with all of it, then we will be able to go ahead and do the remaining ones. This is where I am right now. I need to do at least one video to make sure we are at the same place. Maybe the...

number of the video files is overloading the team, the instructions, but let's see if I can do it. If I'm unable to do it, it is not acceptable for Hanukkah, for Hari,(...) the post-production of Sivati to be able to do this. But if I can do this post-production, you guys should be able to do it as well.

(...)

And if I record all the process,

(...)

okay. Yes, yes. So while you're addressing these gaps, so I just wanted to make a point over here. So like, for example, when you say as I was giving this example, like ensure that the kernel is connected. Instead of saying that, ensure the kernel is connected because I've seen that you've been demonstrating that in that 16 second video, right? So I would suggest you to provide a narration wherein the folks who are with you you to provide a narration wherein you explain the process of ensuring how the kernel is connected. Instead of just saying in the narration that ensure that it's connected, we are actually telling the learner the process of connecting the kernel. If you understand what I'm trying to say over here. So the process has to be explained. The process has to be explained instead of just saying that,(...) make sure that this is connected. So it makes much more relatable for the learner and he would also be able to, he or she would be able to understand. Hanukkah, do you know how I am doing this course? I'm really turning on a system to be able to do an AI model security for open AI for the people who generate these AI systems. I am turning them on this system. There is a working system and there is a working code base for them.

(...)

This is a code base that is working for them. I'm giving them the code. I'm giving them how it is running on here. I'm demonstrating something that is already.

the adversarial evasion lab. So they are getting end to end from the start to the end. But for me to turn it on, I go through all these steps. I take the screenshots first. The screenshots are there. The system is working. Then what I do it is I put the voiceovers. I read the voiceovers. Then there's always the transition lines. And I make sure that I glued the image to the audio to make sure that while I'm reading it. But right now, your problem is you are unable to see it. So what I will do it is I will add a post-production plan so you will be able to get it. There is one more person in the call.

(...)

I hope we are not going to explain it one more time. But I will try to do my best.

(...)

Hello, Luma. How are you?

(...)

What we are trying to do is-- Oh, hi. I found you. I shared the-- It's twice the head of the-- I shared the post-production plan

(...)

for this screen capture piece for the module one and video one. And I'm trying to create a template to make sure that we can all follow this to be able to produce a course for open AI's team for them to be able to do a complex course on AI though. And they have all the necessary code pieces to be able to run this evasion attack. So that's what we are doing. And for this, for each scene, what I provided is a screenshot, a title,(...) a voiceover, a scene number, and the AI Gemini notes with the code pieces. So the post-production can do it. But still,(...) as far as I understood, you guys are not using the AI that much to be able to create a post-production plan. I will create a post-production plan and with artificial intelligence, not myself.

and record it during the process how I create the post-production plan then use my existing footage as an input and Use the AI's plan and then create an output a post-production end-to-end and show the post-production team of star weaver So how you guys can edit one video and I will fix the problems and I will see Where my gaps are on the post-production plan So you guys will be able to give me a go ahead for one screen capture Then I will go ahead and finish the remaining ten screen captures in this style. So that is where we are it

(...)

So you're trying to say that you're going to record My I mean all the elements separately and then you're going to both produce that yeah(...) And give you guys a plan so you guys can follow up that plan This is an advanced level course for open AI steam the people who are using creating the artificial(...) intelligence This course if just shut it will take one hour to two hours just for one module There is ten different tools that comes in in here. So I shut it in a style of 16 seconds screen captures, but it is Overloading the video production team because video production team is having a hard time then to show the audio Then to show the video then to show an animation meant to show the presentation For me it is clear but for them it is not clear. I say top right. It's on the top left. They are unable to(...) Remove the right keyword from the audio. They need to say it's on the top I know it, but they don't know it and I can also relate to them as well though. It is not that easy So I will give them the post-production plan But what I will do is I will go to the AI create a post-production plan for each scene

Put it there for you. I will edit it for you. So you guys will see the input, the footage that I create, the post-production plan that the AI has created. And I will record how I am doing it so you guys can do it for the other videos. And I will show you guys the output so the learner can learn it. The learner meaning the open AI audience can learn how to secure their own models. These are highly technical people. They also don't want a one-hour course.(...) They want three minute video for one screen capture. They will be able to trigger most of these stuff.

(...)

Because the Starweaver is focused on doing the video production, not on the AI pieces, but that open AI people are focused on the AI pieces. When I say code spaces, they understand code spaces. When I say Gemini, they understand Gemini. And to speed this process up, I use the AI and show the learners how I am turning on these systems using artificial intelligence. So there is lots of AI support.(...) This is an AI course. We are going to use the AI to be able to plan it, to be able to produce it, and to be able to post it. I know it is a transformational time for video production to use artificial intelligence as a heads-up display. But I will do it to you guys so you guys will be able to learn how to do this. And I will see where my gaps are in terms of the post-production plan. And Mamed and Svetyal already said this will add one more layer on top. But with this rise of the AI,(...) let me tell you guys something very important. The old jobs are...(...) Bye-bye. This is the reality. There is going to be new jobs. If we go back to 100 years ago, there is lots of people that are doing the horses.

Lots of people that are cleaning the horse shit all over the streets. There are lots of dead horses There was a big economy that economy is gone(...) There is no more video editors in the future. There is no more coders in the future There is all these new roles that are coming up So we are using the AI and you guys are not anymore video editors You guys are AI enabled Something else not a video editor not even a video editor Not even the roles that you guys think so we are entering into that kind of a future I understand we are at that timeline and it is creating an issue for you guys But that is the reality and these guys who are going to take this course are Driving this the open AI people who are going to take this course are driving this So it is okay for them to get a compressed course There I put all these ten different tools that they are going to use and it is creating an overload in you guys I also understand I call it Can you do one thing? Sorry to interrupt you. So if it can we do one thing? Can you simplify this process to because the I'll tell you You you have worked with us and how star we were generally works. It's very simple We just asked the SMEs to create some, you know demo demos using screen shares so With audio so only that pattern there is another type which is which you have already done Which is just a talking head where you are talking in front of the camera so By any chance we can can we simplify this so that you know We follow the process that we are falling from so many years

(...)

only Only your course. I will tell you to be honest only your course where we have to work in a different manner Yes, because I we want you to feel comfortable Mm-hmm

Get ready, get ready, these horses are gonna go. What you are telling me, I am using AI to create this, and you are telling me, why do we have roads? Why do we have cars? We have nice horses here. Why don't we use the horses?

(...)

I feel you should work internally as our internal star viewer team. But you guys are trying to use AI as well in the website.(...) There is lots of stuff written about AI. Come on, use the AI. In production also we use a lot of artificial intelligence, scripting and everything. A lot of it we use it. So I will show you guys how to use AI. The content, SME is very relevant for us and what it comes from, horses, that is a very critical part and we cannot play around with that. The content we receive from you. Yes, I will show how I use the AI, how to create the post-production plan using the existing stuff that I have provided to you guys. So you guys will be able to see and create the video, not just talk. Create the video. I will show you guys. This car can go from New York to San Francisco. And we don't need a horse to go from New York to San Francisco. This car goes very fast. The AI will be able to do the post-production. But right now if you think that you need a horse, you are trying to put the horse inside the car and try to go from New York to San Francisco. I am not trying to do that. I am trying to use the AI to build the course and to make sure we go from A to B. I know it is not easy. I know it is a big change. It is a big transitional time all over the world for everyone. Do not forget these courses for OpenAI. That is for the audience. The title of the courses. How do you secure your AI models? These courses for them.

Yeah, so I will tell you something, Rifat. So what we can do is,(...) you create your first piece of screen shares. According to your style, let's share it with us. Let's you, me and Manu connect once again and see how things can be, you know, much smoother following our process. Uma, hold on. I created 10 screen shares. The screen shares are already created. What the team cannot follow it is when they are going to put the screen shares. That is their problem. The screen shares are already there.

(...)

The screen shares are already created. Manu, can you share some of his screen shares? Look, the screen shares are already created. I think once you start sharing your screen, I think you go there. The screen shares are already created. The images are already there. The voiceover is there. The screen ID is there. They are already there.

(...)

What is not there is the plan to be able to place them step by step is not there.(...) Thus, I already created the screen shares. They are already there and I already read through them. They see this. I tell them, be mindful of the compute costs, it says. While we use free tiers today, training a large scale adversarial attacks in real worlds gets expensive fast. There is an image there and it shows the pricing. And another option is and there is also the transitional light. So I gave you guys the images. I gave you guys the audio.

(...)

Yes,(...) I gave you guys. I'm a bit too loud. I'm in a hotel. I hope I didn't wake up everyone.

(...)

I gave you guys the images. I gave you guys the audio.

So, sorry, image and where to show the video part. So that we are facing and in some slides we are having three images.

(...)

So in the three images we have to show it separately or we have to show it together

(...)

like that we are having that. So Hari, do you have this in the slide format or what is the output? So in Canva there is one Canva entire podcast presentation that has embedded videos seen by scene, every scene is defined, every scene there are images like so there are three images in one video. Now while we have the content for the editors what is the problem here like Difert also said that because he is the expert we as laymen cannot understand what comes into well. While we have the content we do not know how to align it with your view. So do we have that audio script in the notes or where?(...) Inside the video. As well from Difert in the notes also but the note is suppose a three line and when a three line has to have the where does it have to have the image then where does that screen shape play comes in we need to get that in scene. Yes so basically I will tell you this if Difert if you want to follow this approach we call it Stole.

(...)

Types of the other one happen.

(...)

These slides you have rightly placed those errors seen on this particular word this image should have got whatever there is a detail story word has to happen if we have to follow this approach having too many elements.

(...)

And also Uma we have reviewed couple of slides I reviewed it with Difert right here. So the thing is like.

If we have multiple videos right these are code snippets and the intensive right so there are a lot of codes involved if we just have so if that particular image is shown then then can we turn off the cameras maintenance connections going down.

(...)

I think I've discussed this thing with Rifat as well so the cognitive load is something which we'd have to see like for example there is a 16 second demo and we are trying to show that corresponding to a three or four word narration.

(...)

This is something which we'll have to have a look into because there needs to be enough settlement time for the learner to kind of understand what is coming on the screen and there needs to be proper annotations to that point which the SME or Rifat is actually referring to right so this is the actual code which Rifat was talking about so that needs to be kind of annotated or highlighted so those things would need to happen when we provide a very big image or a code snippet right so such things need to be there otherwise it would add a lot of cognitive load for the learner to kind of even understand he or she would not even able to understand what has been even covered right so because things would come and go on the screen. Hanukkah this is not a course for beginners this is for the course who is creating the artificial intelligence they will be able to get this much load because as we said if I make this in one shot this is a one hour two hour video for just three minutes those people do not have first of all that much of a time and they already know when I show them the Gemini you.

or code spaces or Jupyter Labs,

(...)

they already know what is there. So this is an advanced level course, 16 seconds per a screen capture and a three second for an image is enough for them. I'm just gluing all the parts so they can make this work.

(...)

Yeah, so there needs to be proper annotation. Even though it can be for an advanced level learner, that's fine, I understand. They might not need things to be explained in much more detail, but the thing is that there needs to be enough settlement time for anyone who views the video to kind of actually read the things. Not anyone, not anyone. This is just for the open AI team. This is not for everyone. Everyone, I completely agree. Everyone will not be able to get this, such as you go and watch a boxing training,

(...)

heavyweight boxer training, you won't be able to go to street and the heavyweight boxing, somebody will beat you up, a boxer. This is just for the heavyweight boxer. Not for you, not for everyone.

(...)

This is not for everyone.

(...)

But still we need to provide proper annotation. See, the thing is when client reviews it, they are not an expert like you are in this particular subject. So when they also would review, they would understand from this perspective, settlement time, cognitive load and all those things. So these are things which as instructional designers, we take things into consideration.

(...)

Yes, the cognitive load can be taken,(...) by creating animations at the correct timeline. The more animations that you do, the less cognitive load the audience will have. So you need to create such as one side, (Audio Cuts Out)

Told you once they say running state of the kernel, you need to show the kernel animation. So you take the cognitive load from the text and put it to the animation. Yes, you can do that. Take the cognitive load from them by creating animations at the correct time line. So I will give that on the post-production plan to you as well.

(...)

Yeah, so these were some of my observations.

(...)

Yes, let me do one video. Let me do one video with the post-production output and the plan and the input. Then if you see that this can be created with a plan, with the footages, then your questions will be solved. Is that correct? And I show you how I do it on DaVinci Resolve, show all the steps and record myself. Will that be enough or is this not enough?

(...)

I will give you the input, I will give you the plan and I will give you the output, the final output.

(...)

But Rifat, that is going to take time, right? So how long will that take? I will finish this at the end of this weekend. I will give it to you guys.

(...)

Oh, only for the question.(...) Yeah.(...) Because I've already given all the screen captures, all the plan, you guys are seeing, you guys can't do it. I understand, I empathize and I will do it one and record the training for you guys. You guys will take the training and do the post-production.

(...)

That's my thought process. If you guys are unable to do it, somebody says they can do it. I will show you guys how to do it, use the AI. I will use the artificial intelligence, create the post-production plan, implement that post-production plan, show you.

You guys that this is doable, you guys are using the horses. I will use the AI, the car, to go from A to B. Show you guys this can be done by the car. You guys will become less skeptic and say, okay, a car can go from New York to San Francisco and I don't need a horse. I will show the car. The car can move. I will use the AI on the post-production process for the planning. So you guys will be able to say, okay, this plan can be followed. I can use these footages and create them. If all of this is fine. So the idea of using AI is to work faster and smarter, right? So if this is going to delay for another two, three months is not making sense for us. No, no, on this project, I never delayed the time. You talked to my mates. I always gave for Sangha before everybody else. I always waited for the Starweaver site. You guys never ever have waited on my site. Zero time waited on my site. Zero.

(...)

I always gave it to my site. It is on your site.(...) And I'm also okay to create the guides, how you guys are gonna do it. It is on your site. I'm okay to do that.

(...)

I have no issue doing that.

(...)

I will take my time, create the post-production plan, do one video edit and can, because it's only a six minute video. It will take my eight hours, my one weekend. I will be able to finish it off. I still understand. It will take eight hours for me to finish this post-production because I create YouTube videos weekly and it takes around eight hours for me to finish all my YouTube videos for the post-production. I'm not saying it's an easy process, but somebody needs to guide you. I have already created this.

much of a guidance I can go ahead and complete the remaining and you guys will be able to see it and if I have any gaps I will fix it in the processes of there could be gaps that I have that I'm saying there's a car use it but I'm not showing the accelerator I'm not showing the wheel and it might not make sense if you always ridden a horse you have never seen a car you have never seen a wheel it might not make sense I will show it to you because I'm using artificial intelligence to be able to do it. So let's do one thing what I will do is I'll just go through the yeah so what we can do is yeah just allow me one minute so what we can do so what we can do I think somebody's playing somebody's playing but there's an interruption from Arin.

(...)

Can you check your background?

(...)

Hari wants to add something yes Hari what is it that you want to say? No for the in that existing storyboard so it is possible to add so that image if you are showing means just take the audio part so from this audio part to this one show this image or firstly we have to show the video means just make a number of that for a firstly we have to show the video means make it number one and the next we if we have to show the image means make it number two and just place the audio I will do I think that will be easy yes I will have using number code them in each scene so you know which one comes one two three four five and I will put that on my post-production plan and guide there I think that will be that will be easy so instead of creating a new one like I'll share my ones.

Suppose when I guess you got me screen. Yes, I can. Yes, I can. When it comes to this one slide 5, so we have this audio part. So for this slide 5, first we have to show the video part. It means just to mention this one audio part. So from exactly which audio from which were to which one we have to show this video and this image is also there. So we have to show the image this after the video means just to mention it as a number 2 and just to copy and paste that audio part near to that image. We can pick it up that one easily. Alright, I will give you the number codes and how it's going to get edited out on AI generated video production plan and I will go over that video production plan and execute it and make sure that it is usable and you will be able to see the output, the numbers, the plan and the input. So you have everything to be able to create one video and give me a go at but it will take me this weekend to be able to complete it because I'm traveling. I'm in a hotel right now. I will go back to Cambridge and produce it so you will be able to see it. And you need to do is while I'm working on it. Who is the Haruki? I will

(...)

Haruki Shannon. I will give you the I will give you the links during the process of how I am doing it. So you can give me the feedback while we are working together. I will give the update to Haruki Shinny or I will put this to this channel to this chat all the steps on this chat so everybody will be able to see what I'm doing and how I'm going through so you guys will be able to give feedback live. I don't know if you guys are working in the weekend, but I had to do it on the weekend.(...) So because I'm working in IBM

At the moment I would not have the time to do it on today till the weekend But I will add the plans over there

(...)

Okay, okay, let's do that and a real date for that For supporting us For now, I know it's not easy. It's a very transitional time. Let's use the AI I'm using the Gemini 3 right now to be able to do this And I will give all the steps so you guys will be able to Trigger all the prompts that I'm using to be able to create on your site and use it on the other video Productions and this is going to speed up not only this video but every video that the Starweaver creates

(...)

Hopefully this process. Okay

(...)

Okay, yeah

(...)

All right, then we are going to meet next week. I will create the video so put all the outputs here

(...)

Yeah, if it's a shared it is with me We are kind of we are all from the next From the next Monday onwards, but we'll schedule something to look at this so that it is Continue to you guys have a new year's celebration right the Christmas. Yes Yes, all right. Okay. I'm a contractor. So I'm working in Christmas

(...)

That's all right. I will share it with you and share it with this meeting chat Is this meeting just going to be available or not? I don't know but yes I will take a screenshot of everyone that joined this call So they will be able to be free and come in and much. I hope the Sangha runaway. She's like the Rufattis Yes

(...)

Yes, I've won but she's there all right, I will share it as much as I
