## 📽️ Meeting Rewrite: Moving from "Horses" to "Cars"

### 🛑 The Problem: Production Roadblocks

The meeting started with the **Starweaver team** explaining that they are struggling to piece together the advanced AI course.

* 
**Audio Issues**: The audio and video are out of sync (e.g., Slide 6 audio is playing over Slide 7).


* 
**Confusion**: There are too many files (images, videos, and Post-it notes), and the editors don't know which visual belongs to which sentence.


* 
**Fast Pace**: The demonstrations are very technical and move so quickly that the team fears learners will be overwhelmed.



### 💡 The Debate: Who is this for?

* 
**Team Perspective**: Hanuk argued that the "cognitive load" is too high and that even advanced learners need a moment to breathe and see annotations on the code.


* 
**Rifat’s Perspective**: Rifat insisted this is a "heavyweight" course for top-tier engineers at places like OpenAI and NVIDIA. He believes they want "compressed" info, not a slow one-hour lecture.



### 🚗 The Solution: The "AI-Enabled" Plan

Rifat used a metaphor to explain the shift: the team is trying to use **"horses"** (old manual editing ways), but he is building a **"car"** (an AI-driven workflow).

* 
**AI Guidance**: Rifat will use **Gemini** to create a "Post-Production Plan" that tells the editors exactly what to do.


* 
**Numbered Steps**: Every asset will get a number code (1, 2, 3) so Hari knows exactly what comes first.


* 
**Video Tutorial**: Rifat will record himself editing a video to show the team how to use the AI plan.
