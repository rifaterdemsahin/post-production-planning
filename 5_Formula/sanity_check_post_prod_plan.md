# Sanity Check: Post-Production Plan

## Overall Assessment: ✅ **SOLID FOUNDATION** with some areas for refinement

---

## ✅ **STRENGTHS**

1. **Clear narrative progression** - Opens with hook → establishes stakes → introduces technical concept → transitions to targets
2. **Good visual variety** - Mix of text, diagrams, motion graphics, and transitions
3. **Appropriate pacing** - 3-5 second segments allow breathing room
4. **Strong thematic consistency** - Cyber/hacker aesthetic throughout
5. **Canva references included** - Shows pre-production prep work

---

## ⚠️ **AREAS TO ADDRESS**

### **1. Technical Accuracy in Visuals**
- **Mathematical symbols**: Ensure $\delta$, $\nabla$, $\epsilon$ are rendered correctly in motion graphics (not just static text)
- **Neural network diagram**: Should visually match the type of model you're targeting (CNN for images, etc.)

### **2. Visual Hierarchy Concerns**
- **00:07-00:12 segment** may be visually cluttered with network + noise + math symbols all at once
- **Recommendation**: Layer these sequentially (network → noise overlay → math symbols) rather than simultaneously

### **3. Transition Continuity**
- **00:03-00:07**: "Glitch transition" into "split screen" - make sure these don't conflict stylistically
- **00:12-00:15**: "Camera pan" suggests 3D space, but prior segments are 2D - maintain dimensional consistency

### **4. Audio Considerations** *(Not in your plan)*
- Background music/sound design?
- Sound effects for glitches, scanning animations?
- Voiceover tone/pacing alignment with visuals?

### **5. Text Readability**
- Confirm subtitle/title font sizes work at different viewing resolutions (mobile vs desktop)
- "DANGEROUS" in red on dark background - check contrast ratio

## 🎯 **SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS**

| Timing | Issue | Suggestion |
|--------|-------|------------|
| 00:00-00:03 | "Subtle glitch" may be too subtle for hook | Make it punchy - this is your 3-second attention grab |
| 00:07-00:12 | Crowded visual composition | Stagger elements: Network (1s) → Noise layer (1s) → Math symbols (1s) |
| 00:12-00:15 | "Let's look at targets" needs stronger visual payoff | Show recognizable AI logos/names (ResNet, CLIP, etc.) not just generic icons |

## ✍️ **MISSING ELEMENTS TO CONSIDER**

1. **Call-to-action teaser** - "Stay tuned to see which model falls first..."
2. **Branding** - Channel logo/watermark placement?
3. **Accessibility** - Will you include closed captions beyond narration text?
4. **Runtime check** - 15 seconds is short for intro - is this Part 1 of a series?

---

## 🚦 **FINAL VERDICT**

**GREEN LIGHT** with minor revisions. The structure is sound and production-ready. Address the visual layering timing and ensure your Canva assets render well in motion. This will make a compelling cold open for a technical demo video.

**Estimated revision time**: 1-2 hours to refine timing/layering before rendering.
