Based on the "Production Roadblocks" and "Debate" highlighted in your image, the core issue is that the Post-Production team is being asked to "make the course" rather than just "assemble the course."
The editors are feeling overwhelmed because they lack a roadmap. They have a pile of puzzle pieces (files, notes) but no picture on the box to show them how it fits together.
Here is a specific action plan to mitigate these feelings and solve the roadblocks shown in your text.
1. Solve the "Audio Issues" (Sync Drifts)
The Problem: "Slide 6 audio is playing over Slide 7."
This usually happens when the speaker advances a slide while still finishing a thought from the previous one, or they "ramble" between slides.
 * Immediate Action (The "Click" Rule): Instruct the talent/speaker to PAUSE for 2 seconds before clicking to the next slide. They should never speak while clicking or transitioning.
 * The "Visual Clap": If recording screens, have the speaker highlight the slide number with their mouse and click decisively. This gives the editor a visual "spike" to sync the audio to.
 * Producer Step: Do not send the files to post until you have spot-checked that the screen recording frame rate matches the project settings (as mentioned in the previous response).
2. Solve the "Confusion" (Too Many Files)
The Problem: "Editors don't know which visual belongs to which sentence."
The editors are currently guessing. You need to remove the guesswork.
 * Create a "Paper Edit" (The Map): Before editing starts, create a simple 2-column document.
   * Column A: The Script/Spoken Audio filename.
   * Column B: Exact Filename of the image/video that appears.
   * Why: This takes the cognitive load off the editor. They just follow instructions rather than trying to interpret the content.
 * File Naming Protocol: Rename the files to match the script flow.
   * Instead of IMG_4022.jpg, rename it to 06_Slide07_Overlay.jpg. (This tells the editor: "This is the 6th asset, it goes on Slide 7").
3. Resolve the "Fast Pace" Debate (Rifat vs. Hanuk)
The Conflict: Rifat wants "compressed info" (speed) vs. Hanuk wants "breathing room" (cognitive load).
This is a classic "Expert Blind Spot" (Dunning-Kruger). Rifat is likely an expert who thinks the content is easy/obvious. Hanuk realizes learners need processing time.
 * The Compromise: "Visual Breathing Room":
   * Side with Hanuk on pacing but side with Rifat on content density.
   * The Technique: Keep the audio fast and dense (Rifat's wish), but use Pause & Highlight graphics (Hanuk's wish). When a complex code block appears, freeze the video for 3 extra seconds, dim the background, and highlight the specific line of code being discussed.
   * Analogy for Rifat: Tell him, "Even F1 drivers need pit stops. We aren't slowing down the car; we are ensuring the tires stick to the track."
 * Use "Chapter Markers" for Density: If the content is "heavyweight," structure it with clear on-screen chapter titles (e.g., "Step 1: The Setup", "Step 2: The Execution"). This allows advanced users to skip (speed) while forcing a mental "reset" for those who need to breathe.
Summary Checklist for You (The Producer)
| Problem | The Producer's Mitigation (Do this before handing off) |
|---|---|
| Sync Issues | Enforce a "Stop-Click-Speak" rule during recording. |
| File Chaos | Rename all assets to match the sequence (e.g., 01_Intro, 02_CodeDemo). |
| Rifat vs. Hanuk | Decision: Keep the fast audio, but instruct editors to add 2-second "freeze frame" buffers after complex points. |
Next Step: Would you like a template for a "Shot List" document? This is a simple grid you fill out that tells the editor exactly which file goes with which timestamp, eliminating the "Confusion" problem instantly.
