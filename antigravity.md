# Antigravity Project Scan

## 1. Project Overview
**Project**: Post-Production Planning
**Objective**: Develop an efficient, AI-driven workflow for producing advanced technical content. The project aims to transition from traditional manual editing workflows to an AI-enabled post-production process that uses tools like Gemini to create structured editing plans.

## 2. File Structure
*   **Root Directory**
    *   `README.md`: Project overview and documentation.
    *   `16dec-meeting.srt`: Meeting subtitle file.
    *   `Editor_Guidence_WhatsApp Video 2025-12-16 at 06.33.56.mp4`: Video guidance for editors.
    *   `Scene_post_production_Plan.jpeg`: Visual plan/storyboard image.

*   **formulas/** (Documentation & Concepts)
    *   `18_dec_Feedback_call_raw.md`: Raw transcript of feedback call.
    *   `18_dec_meeting_output.md`: Formal meeting summary with action items.
    *   `18_dec_meeting_summary.md`: Narrative rewrite of the meeting.
    *   `feedback-bias-overestimate-ability.md`: Concept paper on cognitive biases.
    *   `mitigation-dunningkruger.md`: Concept paper on mitigating Dunning-Kruger effect.
    *   `references.md`: Links to external resources (Canva designs, agents).
    *   `roadmap-for-editors.md`: Guidance for editors.
    *   `valley-of-despair.md`: Concept paper on the "Valley of Despair" in learning/projects.

## 3. Key Findings
*   **AI-Centric Workflow**: The project explicitly focuses on using AI (Gemini) to generate step-by-step editing plans to reduce cognitive load on editors.
*   **Knowledge Base**: The `formulas` folder serves as a repository for both project-specific documentation (meetings, roadmaps) and broader conceptual frameworks (Dunning-Kruger, etc.) relevant to the team's challenges.
*   **Multimedia Assets**: The project includes video, text (markdown, subtitles), and image assets to support the workflow.

## 4. Next Steps (Inferred)
*   Review meeting notes in `formulas/` to understand immediate action items.
*   Use `roadmap-for-editors.md` to guide the editing process.
*   Refer to `references.md` for external tools.
