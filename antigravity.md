# Antigravity Project Scan

## 1. Project Overview
**Project**: Post-Production Planning
**Objective**: Develop an efficient, AI-driven workflow for producing advanced technical content. The project aims to transition from traditional manual editing workflows to an AI-enabled post-production process that uses tools like Gemini to create structured editing plans.

## 2. File Structure
*   **Root Directory**
    *   `README.md`: Project overview and documentation.
    *   `antigravity.md`: This file.

*   **1_Journey/** (Start/Overview)
    *   `README.md`

*   **2_Real/** (Objectives & Outputs)
    *   `18_dec_meeting_output.md`: Formal meeting summary with action items.
    *   `18_dec_meeting_summary.md`: Narrative rewrite of the meeting.
    *   `Scene_post_production_Plan.jpeg`: Visual plan/storyboard image.

*   **3_Environment/** (Context & Guidelines)
    *   `16dec-meeting.srt`: Meeting subtitle file.
    *   `18_dec_Feedback_call_raw.md`: Raw transcript of feedback call.
    *   `roadmap-for-editors.md`: Guidance for editors.

*   **4_UI/** (User Interface/Experiences)
    *   `README.md`

*   **5_Formula/** (Concepts & Assets)
    *   `Editor_Guidence_WhatsApp_Video.mp4`: Video guidance for editors.
    *   `feedback-bias-overestimate-ability.md`: Concept paper on cognitive biases.
    *   `mitigation-dunningkruger.md`: Concept paper on mitigating Dunning-Kruger effect.
    *   `references.md`: Links to external resources.
    *   `valley-of-despair.md`: Concept paper on the "Valley of Despair".

*   **6_Symbols/** (Source Code & Flows)
    *   `editor_flow.html`: Editor workflow visualization.
    *   `producer_flow.html`: Producer workflow visualization.
    *   `styles.css`: Styles for the flow diagrams.

*   **7_Semblance/** (Logs/Errors)
    *   `README.md`

*   **8_Test/** (Validation)
    *   `README.md`

## 3. Key Findings
*   **AI-Centric Workflow**: The project focuses on using AI to generate editing plans.
*   **Structured Organization**: The project is reorganized into 8 distinct folders (Journey, Real, Environment, UI, Formula, Symbols, Semblance, Test) to separate concerns clearer.
*   **Knowledge Base**: The `5_Formula` folder holds conceptual frameworks and references.
*   **Interactive Tools**: `6_Symbols` contains HTML/CSS visualizations of workflows.

## 4. Next Steps
*   Review meeting notes in `2_Real/`.
*   Follow the `roadmap-for-editors.md` in `3_Environment/`.
*   Utilize the flow diagrams in `6_Symbols/` to understand the process.
