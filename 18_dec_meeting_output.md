This meeting primarily addressed challenges regarding the video production of an advanced AI model security course, specifically focusing on the integration of screen captures, voiceovers, and complex technical concepts.

## Meeting Summary

The discussion centered on the **post-production difficulties** the Starweaver team (Hari, Swati, Sanjia, and Hanuk) is facing with Rifat’s technical content. The team highlighted issues with **audio-video synchronization** (e.g., audio from Slide 6 playing on Slide 7) and the high **cognitive load** for learners due to the rapid pace of technical demonstrations.

Rifat explained that the course is designed for an advanced audience (e.g., OpenAI or NVIDIA developers) and must be compressed to remain concise. To resolve the production bottleneck, Rifat proposed a transition from a manual "storyboard" approach to an **AI-enabled post-production plan**.

## Key Discussion Points

### 1. Technical Synchronization Issues

* 
**Audio/Video Gaps**: The editing team noted that the provided audio does not always match the corresponding screen capture.


* 
**The "Rough" Nature of Assets**: Rifat clarified that he provided "rough" voiceovers with intentional gaps, expecting the post-production team to cut and align them according to the provided Post-it notes and scene IDs.



### 2. Cognitive Load and Pace

* 
**Rapid Demonstrations**: Hanuk expressed concern that 16-second screen captures are too fast for learners to comprehend complex code snippets.


* 
**Target Audience**: Rifat maintained that since the audience consists of AI experts, they do not require basic explanations and prefer high-speed, high-density information.



### 3. Transition to AI-Enabled Planning

* 
**The "Horse vs. Car" Analogy**: Rifat argued that traditional editing workflows ("horses") are becoming obsolete and that the team must use AI ("cars") to plan and execute the edit.


* 
**Standardized Mapping**: The team requested a clearer map (e.g., using number codes 1, 2, 3) to know exactly when to show an image versus a video for specific lines of narration.

## Action Plan

| Action Item | Responsible | Deadline |
| --- | --- | --- |
| <br>**Develop AI Post-Production Plan**: Use Gemini 3 Flash to create a step-by-step editing roadmap for Module 1, Video 1. 

 | Rifat | End of Weekend 

 |
| <br>**Produce a Sample Edited Video**: Edit one full video on DaVinci Resolve to serve as a quality benchmark and template. 

 | Rifat | End of Weekend 

 |
| <br>**Record "Behind-the-Scenes" Training**: Record the screen during the editing process to teach the team how to map assets using the new plan. 

 | Rifat | End of Weekend 

 |
| <br>**Implement Number Coding**: Assign numerical IDs to every asset (images/videos) within each scene to simplify the assembly for Hari. 

 | Rifat | Next Week |
| <br>**Review and Feedback**: Review the benchmark video and AI plan to determine if the workflow is sustainable for the remaining 10 modules. 

 | Starweaver Team | Next Week

**Next Step**: Would you like me to draft the specific AI prompts Rifat mentioned he would use to generate the post-production plan?
